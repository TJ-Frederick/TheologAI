# Release Notes: Version 3.4.0
## Enhanced Discovery & Commentary Navigation

**Release Date:** October 9, 2025

---

## üéâ What's New

Version 3.4.0 dramatically enhances work discovery and commentary navigation with four major features that make TheologAI more powerful and intuitive.

### üîç Dynamic CCEL Catalog Discovery

**Search the entire CCEL catalog, not just a curated list!**

Previously limited to ~40 curated works, TheologAI now dynamically scrapes CCEL's catalog to discover **1000+ available works**. This opens up the entire Christian Classics Ethereal Library for exploration.

**Example Queries:**
- "What other works by Calvin are available?" ‚Üí Finds all 52 Calvin works
- "Show me works about justification" ‚Üí Discovers specialized works like Hooker's "Learned Discourse on Justification"
- "Find Luther's writings" ‚Üí Returns all 16+ Luther volumes

**Technical Details:**
- Smart caching (5-minute TTL) prevents server overload
- Intelligent batching (5 letters at a time)
- Relevance scoring prioritizes best matches
- Graceful fallback to curated list if scraping fails

### üìñ Bible Verse ‚Üí Commentary Section Matching

**Look up Bible verses directly in commentary works!**

The biggest usability improvement in this release: you can now query commentaries using Bible verse references instead of navigating complex TOC structures.

**Example Queries:**
- `work: "calvin/calcom43"`, `query: "1 Timothy 2:14"` ‚Üí Automatically finds section "1 Timothy 2:11-15"
- `work: "calvin/calcom43"`, `query: "2 Timothy 1:7"` ‚Üí Matches correct commentary section

**How It Works:**
- Parses Bible verse references from your query
- Matches single verses to commentary section ranges
- Example: "1 Timothy 2:14" falls within "1 Timothy 2:11-15" section
- Supports verse ranges with intelligent overlap detection
- 100% backward compatible with existing structured queries

**Test Results:** 8/8 tests passing (100% success rate)

### üó∫Ô∏è Calvin Commentary Auto-Routing

**No more guessing which Calvin volume you need!**

Calvin's commentaries are spread across 45 volumes (calcom01-calcom45). This release automatically routes your queries to the correct volume based on the Bible book.

**Example:**
- Old way: "I need 1 Timothy commentary... is that calcom42? calcom43? calcom44?"
- New way: System automatically routes "1 Timothy" ‚Üí `calvin/calcom43`

**Coverage:**
- All 45 volumes mapped
- Covers every book Calvin commented on
- Works with both full book names and abbreviations
- Handles meta-works (calvin/commentaries) with helpful error messages

**Volumes Include:**
- Genesis (calcom01-02), Pentateuch (calcom03-06), Joshua (calcom07)
- Psalms (calcom08-12), Isaiah (calcom13-16), Jeremiah (calcom17-21)
- Ezekiel (calcom22-23), Daniel (calcom24-25), Minor Prophets (calcom26-30)
- Gospels (calcom31-35), Acts (calcom36-37), Romans (calcom38)
- Corinthians (calcom39-40), Galatians-Ephesians (calcom41)
- Philippians-Thessalonians (calcom42), Pastorals (calcom43)
- Hebrews (calcom44), Catholic Epistles (calcom45)

### üîé Topic Search Within Works

**Find relevant sections by keyword or topic!**

Instead of browsing entire TOCs, search for sections within a work by topic.

**Example Queries:**
- `work: "calvin/institutes"`, `topic: "election"` ‚Üí Finds 3 sections about election
- `work: "calvin/institutes"`, `topic: "grace"` ‚Üí Finds sections mentioning grace
- `work: "augustine/confessions"`, `topic: "memory"` ‚Üí Finds relevant chapters

**Features:**
- Searches section titles for keyword matches
- Relevance scoring (exact match > word boundary > partial)
- Results sorted by relevance, then TOC order
- Handles "no matches" gracefully

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Fixed: HTML Parsing for Nested Divs

**Problem:** Regex-based div matching failed when book content contained nested `<div>` elements (footnotes, blockquotes, etc.), causing incomplete text extraction.

**Solution:** Implemented proper div depth counting algorithm that tracks opening/closing tags and finds the correct matching closing div.

**Impact:** More robust text extraction from CCEL, especially for works with complex formatting.

---

### Fixed: TOC Entry Filtering

**Problem:** Prefatory material filter was too aggressive, accidentally filtering valid sections like "calcom43.iv.ii.iii" because they contained ".ii.".

**Solution:** Use word boundaries (`/^[^.]+\.ii($|\.)/`) to match only second-level prefatory material (e.g., "work.ii" or "work.ii.x"), not nested sections.

**Impact:** Commentary volumes now show all valid sections without false filtering.
