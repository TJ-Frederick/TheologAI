Furthermore, it exhorts that they fast at least on every Friday, in memory of the passion of the Lord, and bestow alms on the poor. Furthermore, on every Thursday there shall be celebrated, in the cathedral church, the mass of the Holy Ghost, with the litanies and other prayers appointed to this end; and on the same day there shall be said, in the other churches, at least the litanies and prayers. And during the time that the sacred services are being performed, let there be no talkings or conversations together, but, with mouth and mind, association with the celebrant. And inasmuch as It behoveth bishops to be blameless, sober, chaste, ruling well their own household, [the council] exhorts also that, above all things, each observe sobriety at table, and moderation in diet; further, that, since idle conversations are often wont to arise there, the reading of the divine Scriptures be introduced, even at the tables of bishops; and let each teach and instruct his servants not to be quarrelsome, given to wine, immodest, covetous, haughty, blasphemous, and lovers of pleasures; in fine, let them shun vice and embrace virtue, and in dress, appearance, and in all their actions show forth modesty, as becomes the servants of the servants of God. Moreover, whereas it is the chief care, solicitude, and intention of this sacred and holy council, that, the darkness of heresies, which during so many years has covered the earth, being dispelled, the light, brightness, and purity of Catholic truth may, by the aid of Jesus Christ, who is the true light, shine forth; and that those things which need reformation may be reformed; the same synod exhorts all Catholics here assembled, and to be assembled, and especially those who are skilled in the sacred letters, that by sedulous meditation they diligently reflect within themselves, by what ways and means the intention of the synod may be best directed, and obtain the desired effect; that, in the most prompt and prudent manner, things to be condemned, may be condemned; and things to be approved, approved; that so, throughout the whole world, all may, with one mouth, and with the same confession of faith, glorify God, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. But in delivering their sentiments, when the priests of the Lord are sitting together in the place of benediction, no one, according to the statute of the Council of Toledo, ought either to be boisterous by immoderate outcries, or cause disturbance by uproar; none to be contentious with false, vain, or obstinate disputations; but let whatsoever is said be so tempered by the mildest utterance of the words spoken, that neither the hearers be offended, nor the clear perception of a correct judgment warped by the mind being troubled. Furthermore, this sacred synod has ordained and decreed, that if it should chance to happen that any do not sit in their due place, and [thus] deliver their sentiments, even under the word It pleaseth, are present at the congregations, and take part in any other act soever while the council lasts, none shall thereby be prejudiced, none acquire a new right. After this, the next Session was indicted for Thursday, the 4th of the ensuing month of February.",

This sacred and holy, œcumenical and general Synod of Trent, lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost—the same three legates of the Apostolic See presiding therein—considering the magnitude of the matters to be treated of, especially of those which are comprised under the two heads of the extirpating of heresies, and the reforming of manners, for the sake of which chiefly it is assembled, and recognizing with the apostles, that its wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the spirits of wickedness in the high places, exhorts, with the same [apostle], all and each, above all things, to be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, in all things taking the shield of faith, wherewith they may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the most wicked one, and to take the helmet of salvation, with the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. Wherefore, that this its pious solicitude may have its beginning and progress by the grace of God, it ordains and decrees that, before all other things, a confession of faith is to be set forth; following herein the examples of the Fathers, who, in the most sacred councils, have been wont, at the beginning of the transactions thereof, to oppose this shield against heresies; and with this alone, on some occasions, have they drawn the unbelieving to the faith, overthrown heretics, and confirmed the faithful. Wherefore, it has thought good, that the symbol of faith which the holy Roman Church makes use of, as being that principle wherein all who profess the faith of Christ must necessarily agree, and that firm and only foundation against which the gates of hell shall never prevail, be expressed in the very same words in which it is read in all the churches. Which [symbol] is as follows: I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible; and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, and born of the Father before all ages; God of God, light of light, very God of very God; begotten, not made, of one substance with the Father; by whom all things were made: who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from the heavens, and was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary, and was made man: crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, he suffered and was buried; and he rose again on the third day, according to the Scriptures; and he ascended into heaven, sitteth at the right hand of the Father; and again will come with glory to judge the living and the dead; of whose kingdom there shall be no end: and in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and giver of life, who proceedeth from the Father and Son; who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets: and one holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. I confess one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen. The same sacred and holy, œcumenical and general Synod of Trent, lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same three legates of the Apostolic See presiding therein,—understanding that many prelates from divers places are girt for their journey, and that some also are on their way to come hither; and considering that all that may be decreed by the said sacred synod may seem to be in so much the greater estimation and honour with all men, as it shall have been sanctioned and confirmed by a more numerous and fuller council and attendance of fathers, has resolved and decreed, that the next session after the present one be celebrated on the Thursday after Lætare Sunday next; but that, in the interim, the discussion and examination of those things which shall seem fit to the said synod to discuss and examine be not deferred.",

And it has thought it meet that a catalogue of the sacred books be inserted in this decree, lest doubt arise in any one’s mind as to which are the books that are received by this synod. They are as set down here below: of the Old Testament: the five books of Moses, to wit, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; Josuah, Judges, Ruth, four books of Kings, two of Paralipomena, the first book of Esdras, and the second which is entitled Nehemias; Tobias, Judith, Esther, Job, the Davidical Psalter, [containing] a hundred and fifty psalms; the Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, the Canticle of Canticles, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Isaias, Jeremias, with Baruch; Ezechiel, Daniel; the twelve minor prophets, to wit, Osea, Joel, Amos, Abdias, Jonas, Micheas, Nahum, Habacuc, Sophonias, Aggæus, Zacharias, Malachias; two books of the Machabees, the first and the second. Of the New Testament: the four Gospels, according to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; the Acts of the Apostles written by Luke the Evangelist; fourteen epistles of Paul the apostle, [one] to the Romans, two to the Corinthians, [one] to the Galatians, to the Ephesians, to the Philippians, to the Colossians, two to the Thessalonians, two to Timothy, [one] to Titus, to Philemon, to the Hebrews; two of Peter the apostle, three of John the apostle, one of the apostle James, one of Jude the apostle, and the Apocalypse of John the Apostle. But if any one receive not, as sacred and canonical, these same books entire with all their parts, as they have been used to be read in the Catholic Church, and as they are contained in the old Latin vulgate edition; and knowingly and deliberately despise the traditions aforesaid; let him be anathema. Let all, therefore, understand, in what order, and in what manner, this said synod, after having laid the foundation of the confession of faith, will proceed, and what testimonies and defences it will mainly use in confirming dogmas, and in restoring morals in the Church.",

Furthermore, in order to restrain petulant spirits, It decrees, that no one, relying on his own skill, shall, in matters of faith, and of morals pertaining to the edification of Christian doctrine, wresting the sacred Scripture to his own senses, dare to interpret the said sacred Scripture contrary to that sense which holy mother Church, whose it is to judge of the true sense and interpretation of the holy Scriptures, hath held and doth hold; or even contrary to the unanimous consent of the Fathers; even though suchlike interpretations were never [intended] to be at any time published. They who shall contravene shall be made known by their ordinaries, and be punished with the penalties by law established. And wishing also, as is just, to impose a restraint in this matter upon printers, who now, without restraint, that is, thinking that whatsoever they please is allowable, print, without the license of ecclesiastical superiors, the said books of sacred Scripture, and the annotations and expositions upon them of all persons indifferently, with the press, often unnamed, often even fictitious, and what is more grievous still, without the author’s name; and also indiscriminately keep for sale books of this kind printed elsewhere; [this synod] ordains and decrees, that, henceforth, the sacred Scripture, and especially the aforesaid old and vulgate edition, be printed in the most correct manner possible; and that it shall not be lawful for any one to print, or cause to be printed, any books whatever, on sacred matters, without the name of the author; nor to sell them in future, or even to keep them by them, unless they shall have been first examined, and approved of by the ordinary; under pain of the anathema and fine imposed in a canon of the last Council of Lateran. And, if they be regulars, besides this manner of examination and approval, they shall be bound to obtain a license also from their own superiors, the books having been examined according to the form of their own statutes. But as to those who lend, or circulate them in manuscript, without their having been first examined and approved, they shall be subjected to the same penalties as the printers. And they who shall have them in their possession, or shall read them, shall, unless they discover the authors, be themselves regarded as the authors. And this approbation of books of this kind shall be given in writing; and to this end it shall appear authentically at the beginning of the book, whether the book be written or printed; and all this, that is, both the approbation and the examination, shall be done gratis, so that things to be approved, may be approved, and things to be condemned, condemned. After these matters, wishing to repress that temerity, by which the words and sentences of sacred Scripture are turned and twisted to all manner of profane uses, to wit, to things scurrilous, fabulous, vain, to flatteries, detractions, superstitions, impious and diabolical incantations, divinations, casting of lots, nay, even hereafter defamatory libels; [the synod] commands and enjoins, for the doing away with this kind of irreverence and contempt, and that no one may hereafter dare in any manner to apply the words of sacred Scripture to these and such like purposes; that all men of this description, profaners and violators of the word of God, be restrained by the bishops by the penalties of law and of their own appointment. Likewise, this sacred and holy synod resolves and decrees, that the next ensuing session be held and celebrated on the Thursday after the next most sacred festival of Pentecost.",

If any one does not confess that the first man, Adam, when he had transgressed the commandment of God in Paradise, immediately lost the holiness and justice in which he had been constituted; and that he incurred, through the offence of such prevarication, the wrath and indignation of God, and consequently death, which God had previously threatened to him, and, together with death, captivity under the power of him who thenceforth had the empire of death, that is to say, the devil, and that the entire Adam, through that offence of prevarication, was changed as respects the body and soul, for the worse; let him be anathema. 2. If any one asserts, that the prevarication of Adam injured himself alone, and not his posterity; and that he lost for himself alone, and not for us also, the holiness and justice, received of God, which he lost; or that he, defiled by the sin of disobedience, has only transfused death, and pains of the body, into the whole human race, but not sin also, which is the death of the soul, let him be anathema; inasmuch as he contradicts the apostle, who says: By one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death, and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned. 3. If any one asserts that this sin of Adam, which in its origin is one, and being transfused into all by propagation, not by imitation, is in each one as his own, is taken away either by the powers of human nature, or by any other remedy than the merit of the one mediator, our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath reconciled us to God in his own blood, made unto us righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; or, if he denies that the same merit of Jesus Christ is applied, both to adults and to infants, by the sacrament of baptism rightly administered in the form of the Church; let him be anathema: For there is no other name under heaven given to men, whereby we must be saved. Whence that voice: Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who taketh away the sins of the world; and that other,—As many of you as have been baptized have put on Christ. 4. If any one denies that infants, newly born from their mothers’ wombs, even though they be sprung from baptized parents, are to be baptized; or says that they are baptized indeed for the remission of sins, but that they draw nought of original sin from Adam, which has need to be expiated by the laver of regeneration, for the obtaining life everlasting,—whence it follows, as a consequence, that in them the form of baptism, for the remission of sins, is understood to be not true, but false,—let him be anathema. For that which the apostle has said, By one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death, and so death passed upon all men in whom all have sinned, is not to be understood otherwise than as the Catholic Church spread everywhere hath always understood it. For, by reason of this rule of faith, from a tradition of the apostles, even infants, who could not as yet in themselves commit any sin, are for this cause truly baptized for the remission of sins, that in them that which they have contracted by generation, may be cleansed away by regeneration. For, unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. 5. If any one denies, that, by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is conferred in baptism, the guilt of original sin is remitted; or even asserts that all that which has the true and proper nature of sin is not taken away, but says that it is only erased, or not imputed,—let him be anathema. For, in those who are born again, God hates nothing, because, There is no condemnation to those who are truly buried together with Christ by baptism into death; who walk not according to the flesh, but, putting off the old man, and putting on the new one, who is created according to God, are made innocent, immaculate, pure, harmless, and beloved of God, heirs indeed of God, but joint heirs with Christ; so that there is nothing whatever to retard them from entrance into heaven. But this holy synod confesses and is sensible, that in the baptized there remains concupiscence, or an incentive [to sin]; which, since it is left for us to strive against, cannot injure those who consent not, but resist manfully by the grace of Jesus Christ; yea, he who shall have striven lawfully shall be crowned. This concupiscence, which the apostle sometimes calls sin, the holy synod declares that the Catholic Church has never understood to be called sin, as being truly and properly sin in those born again, but because it is of sin, and inclines to sin. And if any one is of a contrary opinion, let him be anathema. This same holy synod doth nevertheless declare, that it is not in its intention to include in this decree, where original sin is treated of, the blessed and immaculate Virgin Mary, the mother of God; but that the constitutions of Pope Sixtus IV., of happy memory, are to be observed, under the pains contained in the said constitutions, which it renews.",

But, for the future, let no such prebend, prestimony, or stipend be bestowed save on competent persons, and those who can of themselves fulfil that office; and let the provision made otherwise be null and void. But in metropolitan, or cathedral churches, if the city be distinguished or populous, and also in collegiate churches situated in any large town, even though they belong to no diocese, provided the clergy be numerous there; wherein there is no such prebend, prestimony, or stipend, set aside for this purpose, let the prebend that shall first become vacant in any way soever, except by reason of resignation, and to which some other incompatible burthen is not attached, be understood to be ipso facto appointed and set apart to that purpose for ever. And in case that in the said churches there should not be any, or not any sufficient prebend, let the metropolitan, or the bishop himself, by the assigning thereunto of the fruits of some simple benefice, the burthen of the obligations thereto belonging being nevertheless discharged, or by the contributions of the beneficiaries of his city and diocese, or otherwise, as may be most convenient, provide in such wise, with the advice of his chapter, as that the said reading of sacred Scripture be held; yet so that what other readings soever there may be, whether established by custom, or in any other way, be not by any means therefore omitted. As to those churches, however, whose annual revenues may be slight, and where the number of the clergy and laity is so small, that a readership of theology cannot be conveniently held therein, let them at least have a master, to be chosen by the bishop, with the advice of the chapter, to teach grammar gratuitously to clerks, and other poor scholars, that so they may afterwards, with God’s permission, pass on to the said study of sacred Scripture itself. And to this end, either let there be assigned to that master of grammar the fruits of some simple benefice, which he may receive so long as he continues teaching (provided, however, that the said benefice be not deprived of the duty due to it), or let some suitable remuneration be paid him out of the episcopal or capitular income; or, in fine, let the bishop himself devise some other method suited to his church and diocese; that so this pious, useful, and profitable provision may not, under any colourable pretext soever, be neglected. In the monasteries also of monks, where it can be conveniently done, let there be in like manner, a lecture on sacred Scripture, wherein if the abbots be negligent, let the bishops of the places, as the delegates herein of the Apostolic See, compel them thereto by fitting remedies. And in the convents of other regulars, in which studies can conveniently flourish, let there in like manner be a readership of sacred Scripture; which readership shall be assigned by the general or provincial chapters, to the more worthy masters. In the public colleges also, wherein a readership so honourable, and the most necessary of all, has not hitherto been instituted, let it be established by the piety and charity of the most religious princes and states, for the defence and increase of the Catholic faith, and the preservation and propagation of sound doctrine; and where it has been once instituted, and has been neglected, let it be restored. And, lest impiety be disseminated under the semblance of piety, the same holy synod ordains, that no one be admitted to this office of reading, whether in public or in private, who has not been previously examined and approved of by the bishop of the place, as to his life, conversation, and knowledge; which, however, is not to be understood of lecturers in convents of monks. But those who are teaching the said sacred Scripture, as long as they publicly teach in the schools, as also the scholars who are studying in those schools, shall fully rejoice in and enjoy, though absent, all the privileges accorded by common law, as regards the reception of the fruits of their prebends and benefices.",

But if it should happen that the bishops and others aforesaid, be hindered by lawful impediment, they shall be bound, according to the form prescribed by the general council, to appoint fit men to discharge wholesomely this office of preaching. But if any one disdain to execute this, let him be subjected to strict punishment. Archpriests also, curates, and all those who in any manner soever hold any parochial or other churches, which have the cure of souls, shall, at least on the Lord’s days and solemn feasts, either personally, or, if they be lawfully hindered, by others who are competent, feed the people committed to them, with wholesome words, according to their own capacity, and that of their [congregations]; by teaching the things which it is necessary for all to know unto salvation, and by announcing to them with briefness and simplicity of discourse the vices which they must needs avoid, and the virtues which they must follow after, that they may escape everlasting punishment, and obtain the glory of heaven. And if any one of them neglect to discharge this duty, even though he may plead, on whatsoever ground, that he is exempt from the jurisdiction of the bishop, and even though the churches may be, in what manner soever, said to be exempted, or perhaps annexed or united to a monastery that is even out of the diocese, let not the watchful pastoral care of the bishops be wanting, provided [those churches] really be within their diocese; lest that word be fulfilled; The young children have asked for bread, and there was none to break it unto them. Wherefore, if, after having been admonished by the bishop, they shall neglect this their duty for the space of three months, let them be compelled by ecclesiastical censures, or otherwise, according to the discretion of the said bishop; in such wise that even, if this seem to him expedient, some fair remuneration be paid, out of the fruits of the benefices, to another person to discharge that office, until the principal himself, coming to his right senses, shall fulfil his own duty. But should there be found to be any parochial churches, subject to monasteries which are in no diocese, if the abbots and regular prelates be negligent in the matters aforesaid, let them be compelled thereto by the metropolitans, in whose provinces the said dioceses are situated, as the delegates to that end of the Apostolic See; nor let custom, or exemption, or appeal, or reclamation, or action of recovery, have power to impede the execution of this decree; until by a competent judge, who shall proceed summarily, and by examining only into the truth of the fact, the case shall have been taken cognizance of, and decided. But regulars, of what order soever, may not preach even in the churches of their own order, unless they have been examined and approved of concerning their life, manners, and knowledge, by their own superiors, and with their license; with which license they shall be bound to present themselves personally before the bishops, and crave a blessing from them, before they begin to preach.

But let bishops be careful, that no preacher be harassed, either by false accusations, or in any other way calumniously; or have any just cause of complaint against them. Furthermore, let bishops be on their guard not to permit any one, whether of those, who, being regulars in name, live nevertheless out of their cloisters, and the obedience of their religious rules, or secular priests, unless they be known to them, and are approved in morals and doctrine, to preach in their own city or diocese, even under the pretext of any privilege soever; until the holy Apostolic See has been thereon consulted by the said bishops; from which [see] it is not likely that such privileges can be extorted by unworthy persons, except by suppressing the truth, or by uttering falsehood. Those who quest for alms, who are also commonly called Questors, of whatsoever condition they be, shall not in any way presume, either of themselves, or by another, to preach; and those who act contrarily shall, any privileges notwithstanding, be wholly restrained by opportune remedies, by the bishops and ordinaries of the places. The sacred and holy synod also ordains and decrees, that the first ensuing session be held and celebrated on the Thursday after the feast of the blessed apostle James. The session was afterwards prorogued to the thirteenth day of the month of January, 1547.",

Of this justification the causes are these: the final [cause] indeed is the glory of God and of Christ, and eternal life; while the efficient cause is the merciful God, who gratuitously washes and sanctifies, sealing, and anointing with the holy Spirit of promise, who is the earnest of our inheritance; but the meritorious cause is His most beloved only-begotten, our Lord Jesus Christ, who, when we were enemies, for the great charity wherewith he loved us, merited justification for us by His most holy Passion on the wood of the cross, and for us made satisfaction unto God the Father; the instrumental cause, moreover, is the sacrament of baptism, which is the sacrament of faith, without which justification never befell any man; lastly, the sole formal cause is the justice of God; not that by which He himself is just, but that by which He maketh us just, that, to wit, with which we, being endowed by Him, are renewed in the spirit of our mind, and we are not only reputed, but are truly called, and are, just, receiving justice within us, each one according to his own measure, which the Holy Ghost divides to every man severally as He will, and according to each one’s proper disposition and co-operation. For, although no one can be just, but he to whom the merits of the Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ are communicated, yet is this brought to pass in this justification of the impious, when, by the merit of that same most holy Passion, the charity of God is shed abroad, by the Holy Ghost, in the hearts of those who are justified, and is inherent in them; whence man, in the said justification through Jesus Christ, into whom he is ingrafted, receives, together with the remission of sins, all these things infused at once, faith, hope, and charity. For faith, unless to it be added hope and charity, neither unites [man] perfectly with Christ, nor makes him a living member of His body. For which reason it is most truly said, that Faith without works is dead, and idle; and In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by charity. This faith catechumens beg of the Church, agreeably to a tradition of the apostles, previously to the sacrament of baptism; when they beg for the faith which bestoweth life everlasting, which, without hope and charity, faith cannot bestow. Whence also do they straightway hear that word of Christ: If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. Wherefore, when receiving true and Christian justice, they, immediately on being born again, are commanded to preserve it pure and spotless, as the first rabe, given unto them through Jesus Christ, instead of that which Adam, by his disobedience, lost for himself and for us, that so they may bear it before the tribunal of our Lord Jesus Christ, and may have life everlasting.",

But neither is this to be asserted,—that it behoves them who are truly justified, without any doubting whatever, to settle within themselves that they are justified, and that no one is absolved from sins and justified, but he who for certain believes that he is absolved and justified; and that absolution and justification are effected by this faith alone; as though whosoever believeth not this, doubts respecting the promises of God, and the efficacy of the death and resurrection of Christ. For, as no pious person ought to doubt respecting the mercy of God, the merit of Christ, and the virtue and efficacy of the sacraments, so each one, when he regards himself, and his own peculiar weakness and indisposition, may entertain fear and apprehension concerning his own grace; inasmuch as no one can know with a certainty of faith, which cannot be subject to mistake, that he has obtained the grace of God.",

But no one, how much soever justified, ought to think himself free from the observance of the commandments; no one ought to make use of that rash saying, prohibited by the fathers under an anathema; that the commandments of God are impossible for one that is justified to observe. For God commands not impossibilities, but, by commanding, admonishes thee both to do what thou art able, and to pray for what thou art not able, and aids thee that thou mayest be able; whose commandments are not grievous; whose yoke is sweet and whose burden light. For whosoever are the sons of God, love Christ; but they who love him, as Himself doth testify, keep his commandments; which, assuredly, with the divine assistance, they can do. For, although in this mortal life, men, how holy and just soever, at times fall into at least light and daily sins, which are also called venial; yet they do not therefore cease to be just. For that cry of the just, Forgive us our trespasses, is both humble and true; whence it happens, the just themselves ought to feel themselves the more obliged to walk in the way of Justice, in that, being already freed from sins, but made servants unto God, they are able, living soberly, righteously, and godly, to proceed onwards through Jesus Christ, by whom they have had access unto that grace. For God deserts not those who have been once justified by His grace, unless he be first deserted by them. Wherefore, no one ought to flatter himself upon faith alone, deeming that by faith alone he is made an heir, and will obtain the inheritance, even though he suffer not with Christ, that so he may be also glorified together [with him]. For even Christ Himself, as the Apostle saith, though he was the son of God, learned obedience by the things which he suffered, and being made perfect, he became the cause of eternal salvation unto all who obey him.iFor which reason the same Apostle admonishes the justified, saying: Know ye not that they which run in the race, run all indeed, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly: so fight I, not as one that beateth the air; but I chastise my body, and bring it into subjection; lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should become a cast-away. So also the prince of the apostles, Peter: The rather give diligence, that by good works ye may make sure your calling and election. For if ye do these things, you shall not sin at any time. Whence it is certain, that those who are opposed to the orthodox doctrine of religion, who say that the just man sins, venially at least, in every good work: or, which is still more insupportable, that he merits eternal punishments; as also those who state, that the just sin in all their works, if in those [works] they, in order to stimulate their own sloth, and to encourage themselves to run in the course, besides this chief aim, that God be glorified, regard also the eternal reward; whereas it is written, I have inclined my heart to do all thy justifications for the, reward; and, concerning Moses, the Apostle saith, that he had respect unto the reward.",

For this manner of justification is unto the fallen the reparation, which the holy fathers have aptly called a second plank after the shipwreck of grace lost. For, on behalf of those who after baptism fall into sins, Christ Jesus instituted the sacrament of penance, when He said, Receive ye the Holy Ghost; whosesoever sins ye shall remit, they are remitted unto them, and whosesoever sins ye shall retain, they are retained. Whence it is to be taught, that the penitence of a Christian man after his fall, is very different from that at his baptism; and that therein are included not only a cessation from sins, and a detestation thereof, or, a contrite and humble heart, but also the sacramental confession of the same sins, at least in desire, and to be made in its season, and sacerdotal absolution; and likewise satisfaction by fasts, almsgivings, prayers, and the other pious exercises of a spiritual life; not indeed for the eternal punishment, which is, together with the guilt, remitted, either by the sacrament, or by the desire of the sacrament; but for the temporal punishment, which, as the sacred writings teach, is not always wholly remitted, as is done in baptism, unto those who, ungrateful to the grace of God which they have received, have grieved the Holy Spirit, and have not feared to defile the temple of God.

For this is that crown of righteousness which the Apostle asserted was, after his fight and course, laid up for him, to be given to him by the righteous judge, and not only to him, but unto all that love his coming, For, whereas Jesus Christ Himself, as the head into the members, and the vine into the branches, continually causes his virtue to flow into the said justified, which virtue always precedes and accompanies and follows after their good works, and without which it could not in anywise be pleasing and meritorious before God, we must needs believe that to the justified nothing further is wanting, but that they be accounted to have, by those very works which have been done in God, fully satisfied the divine law according to the state of this life, and truly to have merited eternal life, to be obtained also in its due time; if so be, however, that they shall have departed in grace: forasmuch as Christ, our Saviour, saith: If any one shall drink of the water that I shall give him, he shall not thirst for ever; but it shall become in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. Thus, neither is our own righteousness established as our own as from ourselves; nor is the righteousness of God denied or repudiated: for that righteousness which is called ours, because we are justified from its being inherent in us, that same is [the righteousness] of God, because it is infused into us of God, through the merit of Christ. Nor is this to be omitted, that, although, in the sacred writings, so much is attributed to good works, that Christ promises, that even he that shall give a drink of cold water to one of his least ones, shall not lose his reward; and the Apostle bears witness that, That which is at present but for a moment and light of our tribulation, worketh for us a far more exceeding eternal weight of glory; nevertheless far be it that a Christian man should either trust or glory in himself, and not in the Lord, whose goodness towards all men is so great, that He will have the things which are His own gifts to be their own merits. And whereas in many things we all offend, each one ought to have before his eyes, as well severity and judgment, as mercy and goodness; neither ought any one to judge himself, even though he be not conscious to himself of anything; inasmuch as the whole life of man is to be examined and judged, not by the judgment of men, but of God, who will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then shall every man have praise of God, who, as it is written, will render to every man according to his works. After this Catholic doctrine on justification, which whosoever receiveth not faithfully and firmly cannot be justified, it hath pleased the holy synod to subjoin these canons, that all may Know not only what they ought to hold and follow, but also what to avoid and shun.

      "content": "It is fitting that Prelates reside in their own Churches; if they shall do otherwise, the Penalties of the Ancient Law are renewed against them, and new ones decreed. The same sacred and holy synod,—the same legates of the Apostolic See presiding, wishing to grid itself unto the restoring of ecclesiastical discipline, which is exceedingly relaxed, and to amending the depraved manners of the Christian clergy and people, has thought fit to begin with those who preside over the greater churches; for the integrity of those in authority is the safety of those in subjection. Trusting, therefore, that through the mercy of our Lord and God, and the provident care of His own vicar upon earth, it will surely come to pass that those who are most worthy, and whose previous life and whole career from their early infancy to their riper years, having been laudably passed in the exercises of ecclesiastical discipline, bears testimony in their favour, will be taken unto the government of churches, according to the venerable ordinances of the fathers, since it is a burden to be dreaded even by angels; [the synod] admonishes all those who, under whatsoever name and title, are set over any patriarchal, primatial, metropolitan, and cathedral churches, and accounts all such admonished, that, taking heed to themselves, and to the whole flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath placed them to rule the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood, they watch, as the Apostle enjoins, that they labour in all things, and fulfil their ministry. But let them know, that they cannot fulfil it, if, after the manner of hirelings, they abandon the flocks committed to them, and apply not to the keeping of their own sheep, whose blood will be required at their hands, by the Supreme Judge; since it is most certain that, if the wolf have devoured the sheep, and the shepherd knew not thereof, the shepherd’s excuse will not be admitted. And nevertheless, whereas some are to be found at this time, who, as is earnestly to be lamented, forgetful even of their own salvation, and preferring earthly things to heavenly and human things to divine, wander about in various court or, their fold forsaken, and the care of the sheep commit to them neglected, keep themselves busied with the cares temporal affairs; it hath seemed fit to this sacred and holy synod to renew, as by virtue of the present decree it doth renew, the ancient canons promulgated against non-residents, which [canons] have, through the disorders of the times and of men, almost fallen into desuetude; and furthermore, in order to the more fixed residence of the same, and for the reforming of manners in the church, it hath seemed good to ordain and sanction in the manner following:— If any one, by what dignity, degree, and pre-eminence soever he may be distinguished, shall, by remaining six consecutive months out of his own diocese, all lawful impediment, or just and reasonable causes being wanting, be absent from a patriarchal, primatial, metropolitan, or cathedral church, under whatsoever title, cause, name, or right committed to him, he shall, by virtue of his condust, incur the penalty of the forfeiture of a fourth part of one year’s fruits, to be applied, by an ecclesiastical superior, to the fabric of the church and to the poor of the place. But if he continue in such like absence during six other months, he shall, by virtue of such conduct, forfeit another fourth part of the fruits, to be applied in like manner. But if the contumacy increase,—to the end that he may be subjected to a severer censure of the sacred canons, the metropolitan shall be obliged to denounce his absent suffragan bishops, and the oldest resident suffragan bishop to denounce his absent metropolitan, to the Roman pontiff, either by letters or by messenger, within the space of three months, under the penalty, to be by such conduct incurred, of being interdicted from entering into the church; who, by the authority of his own supreme see, may animadvert upon the said absentees, according as the greater or less contumacy of each may require, and provide the said churches with more useful pastors, as he shall know in the Lord to be salutarily expedient.",

Wherefore, the sacred and holy, œcumenical and general Council of Trent, lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost, the same legates of the Apostolic See presiding therein,—in order to destroy the errors and to extirpate the heresies, which have appeared in these our days respecting the said most holy sacraments, as well those which have been revived from the heresies condemned of old by our fathers, as also those newly invented, which are exceedingly prejudicial to the purity of the Catholic Church, and to the salvation of souls,—[the aforesaid council] adhering to the doctrine of the holy Scriptures, to the apostolic traditions, and to the consent of other councils and of the Fathers, has thought fit to establish and decree these present canons; intending, the divine Spirit aiding, to publish hereafter the remaining canons which are wanting for the completion of the work begun.

For neither are these things mutually repugnant, that our Saviour Himself ever sitteth at the right hand of the Father in heaven, according to the natural mode of existing, and that, nevertheless, He be, in many other places, sacramentally present unto us in his own substance, by that manner of existing, which, though we can scarcely express it in words, we yet can, by the understanding illuminated by faith, suppose, and ought most faithfully to believe, to be possible unto God. For thus all our forefathers, as many as were in the true Church of Christ, who have discoursed of this most holy sacrament, have most openly professed, that our Redeemer instituted this so admirable a sacrament at the last supper, when, after the blessing of the bread and wine, He bore witness, in distinct and clear words, that He gave them His own very Body, and His own Blood; words which, recorded by the holy Evangelists, and afterwards repeated by St. Paul, whereas they carry with them that proper and most manifest meaning according to which they were understood by the fathers, it is indeed a crime the most unworthy that they should be wrested, by certain contentious and wicked men, unto fictitious and imaginary figures of speech, whereby the verity of the flesh and blood of Christ is denied, contrary to the universal sense of the Church, which, as the pillar and stay of truth, has detested, as satanical, these inventions devised by impious men; she recognizing, with a mind ever grateful, and remembering, this most excellent benefit of Christ.",

And He also willed that this sacrament should be received as the spiritual food of souls, whereby may be nourished and strengthened those who live with His life, who said, He that eateth me, he also shall live by me; and as an antidote, by the which we may be freed from daily faults, and preserved from mortal sins. He willed, furthermore, that it should be a pledge of our glory to come, and of everlasting happiness, and thus be a symbol of that one body of which He is the head, and to which He would fain have us, as members, be united by the closest bond of faith, hope, and charity, that we might all speak the same thing, and there might be no schisms among us.",

For the apostles had not as yet received the Eucharist from the hand of the Lord, when, nevertheless, Himself truly affirmed that to be His own body which He presented. And this faith has ever been in the Church of God, that, immediately after the consecration, the very Body of our Lord, and His very Blood, together with His soul and divinity, exist under the species of bread and wine; but the Body indeed under the species of bread, and the Blood under the species of wine, by the force of the words; but the body itself under the species of wine, and the blood under the species of bread, and the soul under each, by the force of that natural connexion and concomitancy by which the parts of Christ our Lord, who hath now risen from the dead, to die no more, are united together; and the divinity, furthermore, on account of that admirable hypostatical union thereof with His body and soul. Wherefore it is most true, that as much is contained under either species as under each; for Christ whole and entire is under the species of bread, and under any part soever of that species; likewise the whole [Christ] is under the species of wine, and under its parts.",

For it is not the less to be worshipped on this account, that it was instituted by Christ, the Lord, to be received. For we believe that same God to be present therein, concerning whom the eternal Father, when introducing him into the world, says; And let all the angels of God adore him; whom the Magi, falling down, worshipped; who, in fine, as the scripture beareth witness, was worshipped by the apostles in Galilee. The holy Synod declares, moreover, that very piously and religiously was this custom introduced into the Church, that this most sublime and venerable sacrament should be, with special veneration and solemnity, celebrated, every year, on a certain day, and that a festival; and that it should be borne reverently and with honour in processions through the streets, and public places. For it is most just that there be certain stated holy days, when all Christians may, with a special and unusual demonstration, testify that their minds are grateful and mindful towards their common Lord and Redeemer for so ineffable and truly divine a benefit, whereby the victory and triumph of His death are represented. And so indeed did it behove victorious truth to celebrate a triumph over falsehood and heresy, that thus her adversaries, at the sight of so much splendour, and placed in the midst of so great joy of the universal Church, may either pine away, weakened and broken; or, touched with shame, and confounded, at length repent.",

Wherefore, by him who would communicate, must the precept of the apostle be recalled to mind; Let a man prove himself. But ecclesiastical usage declares that necessary proof to be, that no one, conscious to himself of deadly sin, how contrite soever he may seem to himself, ought to approach the sacred Eucharist without sacramental confession preceding. This the holy synod hath decreed is to be perpetually observed by all Christians, even by those priests on whom by their office it may be incumbent to celebrate, provided the opportunity of a confessor fail them not. But if, necessity being urgent, a priest should celebrate without previous confession, let him confess as soon as possible.",

For they have taught that some receive it sacramentally only, to wit, sinners: others spiritually only, those, to wit, who eating in desire that heavenly bread which is set before them, are, by the lively faith which worketh by love, made sensible of the fruit and utility thereof: whereas the third receive it both sacramentally and spiritually; and these are they who so prove and prepare themselves beforehand, that they approach this divine table clothed with the wedding garment. Now as to the reception of the sacrament, it was always the custom in the Church of God, that laymen should receive the communion from the priests; but that the priests when celebrating should communicate themselves; which custom, as coming down from an apostolical tradition, ought with justice and reason to be retained. And finally, this holy synod with fatherly affection admonishes, exhorts, entreats, and beseeches, by the bowels of the mercy of our God, that all and each of those who are reckoned under the Christian name, would now at length join and agree in this sign of unity, in this bond of charity, in this symbol of concord; and that, mindful of the so great majesty, and the so exceeding love of our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave unto us His own beloved soul as the price of our salvation, and gave unto us His own flesh to eat, they would believe and venerate these sacred mysteries of His body and blood with such constancy and firmness of faith, with such devotion of soul, with such piety and worship, as to be able to receive frequently that supersubstantial bread, and that it may be to them truly the life of the soul, and the perpetual health of their mind; that, by the strength thereof, being invigorated, they may, after the journeying of this miserable pilgrimage, be able to arrive at their heavenly country, to eat, without any veil, that same bread of angels which they now eat under the sacred veils. But whereas it is not enough to declare the truth, if errors be not laid open and repudiated, it hath seemed good to the holy synod to subjoin these canons, that all, the Catholic doctrine being already recognized, may also understand what are the heresies against which they ought to guard and avoid.

Should they, however, happen to sin in any manner through human frailty, that precept of the apostle is to be observed by them, that they reprove, entreat, rebuke them in all kindness and patience, since benevolence towards those to be corrected often effects more than austerity, exhortation more than menacing, charity more than power. But if, on account of the grievousness of the transgression, there be need of the rod, then is rigour to be used with gentleness, judgment with mercy, severity with lenity; that so discipline, salutary and necessary for the people, may be preserved without harshness; and that they who are chastised may be amended; or, if they be unwilling to repent, that others, by the wholesome example of their punishment, may be deterred from vices; since it is the office of a pastor, at once diligent and kind, first to apply gentle fomentations to the disorders of his sheep, afterwards, when the grievousness of the distemper may require them, to proceed to sharper and more painful remedies; but if not even these are effectual in removing those disorders, then is he to free the other sheep at least from the danger of contagion.

But because God, rich in mercy, knoweth our frame, he hath bestowed a remedy of life even upon those who, after baptism, may have delivered themselves up to the servitude of sin and the power of the devil, the sacrament, to wit, of penance, by which the benefit of Christ’s death is applied to those who have fallen after baptism. Penitence was indeed ever necessary, in order to attain to grace and justice, for all men who had defiled themselves by any deadly sin, even for those who had begged to be washed by the sacrament of baptism; that so, their perverseness cast aside and amended, they might, with a hatred of sin and a pious sorrow of mind, detest so great an offence of God. Whence the prophet saith: Be turned, and do penance from all your iniquities, and iniquity shall not be your ruin. The Lord also said,—Except ye do penance, ye shall all likewise perish. And Peter, the prince of the apostles, recommending penitence to sinners who were about to be initiated by baptism, said, Do penance, and be baptized every one of you. Nevertheless, neither before the coming of Christ was penitence a sacrament, nor is it such, since his coming, to any one previously to baptism. But the Lord then especially instituted the sacrament of penance, when, being raised from the dead, He breathed upon His disciples, saying, Receive ye the Holy Ghost; whose sins ye shall remit, they are remitted unto them, and whose sins ye shall retain, they are retained. By which action so signal, and words so clear, the consent of all the fathers has ever understood, that the power of remitting and retaining sins was communicated to the apostles and their lawful successors, unto the reconciling of the faithful who have fallen after baptism. And the Novatians, who of old pertinaciously denied the power of forgiving, the Catholic Church with great reason repudiated and condemned as heretics; wherefore this holy synod, approving and receiving as most true this meaning of those words of our Lord, condemns the laboured interpretations of those who, contrary to the institution of this sacrament, falsely wrest those words to the power of preaching the word of God, and of announcing the Gospel of Christ.",

For, besides that it is very far different indeed in matter and form, by which the essence of a sacrament is made up, it is certainly known that the minister of baptism need not be a judge, since the Church exercises judgment on no one who has not first entered therein through the gate of baptism. For, What have I, saith the Apostle, to do to judge them that are without? It is otherwise with those who are of the household of faith, whom Christ our Lord has once, by the laver of baptism, made the members of His own body. For these, it they should afterwards have defiled themselves by any crime, He would no longer will that they be cleansed by a repetition of baptism, that being nowise lawful in the Catholic Church, but be placed as criminals before this tribunal; so that, by the sentence of the priests, they might be freed, not once only, but as often as, being penitent, they should, from their sins committed, flee thereunto. Furthermore, one is the fruit of baptism, and another that of penance. For, by baptism putting on Christ, we are therein made entirely a new creature, obtaining a full and entire remission of all sins; unto which newness and entireness, however, we are in no wise able to arrive by the sacrament of penance, without many tears and labours on our part, the divine justice demanding this; so that penance has with reason been styled by holy fathers a laborious kind of baptism. And this sacrament of penance is necessary unto salvation for those who have fallen after baptism; even as baptism itself is for those who have not as yet been regenerated.",

Which acts, inasmuch as they are, form God’s institution, required in the penitent for the integrity of the sacrament, and for the full and perfect remission of sins, are for that reason called the parts of penance. But the thing indeed, and the effect of this sacrament, as far as appertains to its force and efficacy, is reconciliation with God, which sometimes, in pious persons, who receive this sacrament with devotion, is wont to be accompanied by peace and serenity of conscience, with earnest consolation of spirit. The holy synod, delivering these matters touching the parts and the effect of this sacrament, at the same time condemns the opinions of those who contend, that, the terrors which smite the consceince, and faith, are the parts of penance.",

Now this movement of contrition was at every time necessary for obtaining the pardon of sins; and, in a man who has fallen after baptism, it thus at length prepares for the remission of sins, if it be united with confidence in the divine mercy, and with the desire of performing the other things which are required for rightly receiving this sacrament. The holy synod therefore declares, that this contrition not only contains a cessation from sin, and the purpose and beginning of a new life, but also a hatred of the old, according to that saying: Cast away from you all your iniquities, in which you have transgressed, and make to yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. And assuredly he who has considered those cries of the saints: Against thee only have I sinned, and have done evil in thy sight, I am weary with my groaning, every night I will wash my bed, I will recount to thee all my years, in the bitterness of my soul; and others of this kind, will easily understand that they flowed from a certain vehement hatred of their past life, and from a great detestation of sins. [The synod] teaches furthermore, that, although it may sometimes happen that this contrition is perfect through charity, and reconciles man with God before this sacrament be actually received, the said reconciliation, nevertheless, is not to be ascribed to that contrition, without the desire of the sacrament which is included therein. And as to that imperfect contrition, which is called attrition, because it is commonly conceived either from the consideration of the turpitude of sin, or from the fear of hell and of punishments, it declares that if, with the hope of pardon, it exclude the will to sin, it not only does not make a man a hypocrite, and a greater sinner, but that it is even a gift of God, and an impulse of the Holy Ghost, who does not indeed as yet dwell in the penitent, but only moves him, whereby the penitent being assisted, prepares a way for himself unto justice. And although this [attrition] cannot of itself, without the sacrament of penance, bring the sinner unto justification, yet does it dispose him to obtain the grace of God in the sacrament of penance. For, profitably stricken with this fear, the Ninevites, at the preaching of Jonah, did penance full of terror, and obtained mercy from the Lord. Wherefore falsely do some calumniate Catholic writers, as though they had stated that the sacrament of penance confers grace without good motion on the part of those who receive it: a thing which the Church of God never taught or thought. And falsely also do they teach that contrition is extorted and compelled, not free and voluntary.",

      "content": "On Confession From the institution of the sacrament of penance already explained, the universal Church has always understood, that the entire confession of sins was also instituted by the Lord, and is of divine right necessary to all who have fallen after baptism; because that our Lord Jesus Christ, when about to ascend from earth to heaven, left priests His own vicars, as presidents and judges, before whom all the mortal crimes, into which the faithful of Christ may have fallen, should be brought, to the end that, according to the power of the keys, they may pronounce the sentence of remission or retention of sins. For it is certain, that priests could not have exercised this judgment, the cause being unknown; neither indeed could they have observed equity in enjoining punishments, if they should have declared their sins in general only, and not rather specifically, and singly. Hence it is gathered that all the deadly sins, of which, after a diligent examination of themselves, they have consciousness, must needs be enumerated by penitents in confession, even though those sins be most hidden, and committed only against the two last precepts of the decalogue; which sometimes wound the soul more grievously, and are more dangerous, than those which are committed outwardly. For venial sins, by which we are not excluded from the grace of God, and into which we more frequently fall, although they be rightly and profitably, and without any presumption declared in confession, as the custom of pious persons shows, yet may be passed over without guilt, and be expiated by many other remedies. But whereas, all mortal sins, even those of thought, render men children of wrath, and enemies of God, it is necessary to seek also for the pardon of them all from God, with an open and modest confession. Wherefore, while the faithful of Christ are anxious to confess all the sins which occur to their memory, they without doubt lay them all open before the mercy of God to be forgiven. But they who act otherwise, and knowingly keep back certain [sins], set nothing before the divine bounty to be remitted through the priest. For if the sick be ashamed to display his wound to the physician, his medical art cures not that which it knows not. It is furthermore inferred, that those circumstances also, which change the species of the sin, are to be explained in confession, because that, without them, the sins are neither entirely set forth by the penitents, nor are they known [fully] to the judges; and it cannot be that they can rightly estimate the grievousness of the crimes, and impose on the penitents the penalty which ought to be inflicted, on account of them. Whence it is unreasonable to teach that these circumstances have been devised by idle men; or, that one circumstance only is to be confessed, to wit, that one has sinned against a brother. But it is also impious to say, that confession, enjoined to be made in this manner, is impossible, or to call it a slaughterhouse of consciences: for it is certain, that in the Church nothing else is required of penitents, but that, after each has examined himself diligently, and examined all the folds and recesses of his conscience, he confess those sins by which he shall remember that he has in a deadly manner offended his Lord and God: whilst the other sins, which do not occur to him after diligent considering, are understood to be included as a whole in that same confession; for which sins we confidently say with the prophet: From my secret [faults] cleanse me O Lord. Now the very difficulty of such a confession, and the shame of laying bare one’s sins, might indeed seem grievous, if it were not alleviated by the so many and so great advantages and consolations, which are most assuredly conferred by absolution upon all who worthily approach this sacrament. But, as to the manner of confessing secretly to a priest alone, although Christ has not forbidden that a person may, in punishment of his own sins, and for his own humiliation, as well for an example unto others as for the edification of the offended Church, confess his sins publicly; nevertheless this is not commanded by a divine precept, neither would it be altogether prudent if it should be enjoined by any human law, that sins, especially such as are secret, should be laid open by a public confession. Wherefore, whereas the secret sacramental confession, the Holy Church hath used from the beginning, and doth still also use, has always been commended by the most holy and the most ancient fathers with great and unanimous consent, the vain calumny is manifestly refuted of those, who are not ashamed to teach, that confession is alien from the divine command, and is a human invention, and that it took its rise from the fathers assembled in the Council of Lateran: for the Church did not, through the Council of Lateran, ordain that the faithful of Christ should confess, a thing which it knew to be necessary, and instituted of divine right, but that the precept of confession should be fulfilled, at least once a year, by all and each, when they should have attained to years of discretion. Whence, throughout the universal Church, to the great benefit of the souls of the faithful, the salutary custom is now observed of confessing at that most sacred and most acceptable time of Lent, which custom this holy synod most highly approves and embraces, as pious, and with reason to be retained.",

It also teaches, that even priests, who are held in deadly sins, through the virtue of the Holy Ghost bestowed in ordination, exercise the function of remitting sins, as the ministers of Christ; and that they think erroneously who contend that this power exists not in bad priests. But although the absolution of the priests is the dispensation of another’s bounty, yet is it not a bare ministry only, whether of announcing the Gospel, or of declaring that sins are remitted, but is after the manner of a judicial act, which by sentence is pronounced by the priest as by a judge. And therefore the penitent ought not so to flatter himself concerning his own personal faith, as to think that, even though there be no contrition on his part, or no intention on the part of the priest acting seriously and absolving truly, he is, nevertheless, truly, and in the eyes of God absolved, on account of his faith alone. For neither would faith without penance bestow any remission of sins; nor would he be otherwise than most negligent of his own salvation, who should know that a priest but absolved him in jest, but should not earnestly seek for another who would act in earnest.",

And to our most holy Fathers it hath seemed to appertain greatly to the discipline of the Christian people, that certain more atrocious and more grievous crimes should be absolved, not by all priests, but only by the highest: whence the Sovereign Pontiffs, by virtue of the supreme power delivered to them in the universal Church, were, with reason, able to reserve certain more grievous cases of crimes for their special judgment. Since, moreover, all things that are from God are well ordered, it is not to be doubted, but that this same may lawfully be done by all bishops, each in his own diocese, unto edification, however, not unto destruction, by virtue of the authority, above that of the other inferior priests, delivered to them over their subjects, especially as far as concerns those crimes to which the censure of excommunication is annexed. But it is consonant to the divine authority, that this reservation of cases should have effect, not merely in external polity, but also in the sight of God. Nevertheless, lest any should perish on this very account, it has always been very piously observed in the said Church of God, that there be no reservation at the point of death, and therefore, that all priests may [then] absolve all penitents whatsoever from all manner soever of sins and censure: and whereas, save only at that point [of death], priests have no influence in reserved cases, let them endeavour to persuade penitents to this alone, to repair to superior and lawful judges for the benefit of absolution.",

For clear and distinct examples are found in the sacred writings, by which, besides by divine tradition, this error is refuted in the plainest manner possible. And, in good truth, the nature of divine justice seems to demand, that in one manner, they, who through ignorance have sinned before baptism, be received into grace; and in another, those who, after having been freed from the servitude of sin and of the devil, and having received the gift of the Holy Ghost, have not feared, knowingly to defile the temple of God, and to grieve the Holy Spirit. And it becomes the divine clemency, that sins be not in such wise remitted unto us without any satisfaction, as that, occasion being obtained, thinking sins less grievous, we, having done as it were an insult and a despite unto the Holy Ghost, should fall into more grievous sins, treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath. For, without doubt, these satisfactory punishments greatly recall from sin, and restrain as it were with a bridle, and make penitents more cautious and watchful for the future; they also furnish remedies for the remains of sin, and, by opposite acts of the virtues, they remove the vicious habits acquired by evil living. Neither indeed was there any way ever in the Church of God accounted surer to turn away the punishment impending at the hands of the Lord, than that men should, with true sorrow of mind, frequently practise these works of penitence. It adds further to these things, that, whilst we, by making satisfaction, suffer for our sins, we are made conformable to Christ Jesus, who satisfied for our sins, from whom all our sufficiency is; thence, having also a most sure pledge, that if we suffer with him, we shall also be glorified with him. But neither is this satisfaction, which we discharge for our sins, so much our own, as not to be through Jesus Christ. For we who can do nothing of ourselves, as of ourselves, can do all things, He co-operating, who strengthens us. Thus, man has not wherein he should glory, but all our glorying is in Christ: in whom we live; in whom we merit; in whom we satisfy; bringing forth fruits worthy of penance, which from him derive their virtue; by him are offered unto the Father; and through him are accepted by the Father. Therefore the priests of the Lord ought, as far as the Spirit and prudence shall suggest, to enjoin salutary and fitting satisfactions, according to the quality of the crimes and the ability of the penitents; lest, if by chance they connive at sins, and deal too indulgently with penitents, by enjoining certain very light works for the most grievous crimes, they be made partakers of other men’s sins. But let them have before their eyes, that the satisfaction which they impose be not only unto the preservation of a new life, and a medicine for infirmity, but also unto the avenging and punishing of past sins. For likewise, the ancient fathers both believe and teach, that the keys of the priests were given, not to loose only, but also to bind. But not, therefore, did they suppose that the sacrament of Penance is a court of wrath or of punishments; even as no Catholic ever thought, that, by this kind of satisfactions on our part, the virtue of the merit and of the satisfaction of our Lord Jesus is either obscured, or to any extent lessened: which, while the innovators wish to understand, they in such wise teach that a new life is the best penance, as to take away the entire virtue and use of satisfaction.",

On the sacrament of extreme unction It hath, moreover, seemed good to the holy synod, to subjoin to the preceding doctrine on penance the one following touching the sacrament of Extreme Unction, which was regarded by the Fathers as the completion, not only of penance, but also of the whole Christian life, which ought to be a perpetual penance. First, therefore, concerning its institution, it declares and teaches, that our most clement Redeemer, who would have his servants at all times provided with salutary remedies against all the weapons of all their enemies, like as, in the other sacraments, He prepared the greatest aids, by the which, during life, Christians may preserve themselves whole from every more grievous evil of the spirit, so did He guard the close of life by the sacrament of Extreme Unction, as with a most firm defence. For although our adversary seeks and seizes opportunities throughout our whole life, to be able in any way to devour our souls; yet, there is no time wherein he more vehemently strains all the powers of his cunning to ruin us utterly, and, if he possibly can, to make us fall even from trust in the divine mercy, than when he perceives the end of our life to be impending. chapter I Concerning the Institution of the Sacrament of Extreme Unction Now, this sacred unction of the sick was instituted by Christ our Lord, as truly and properly a sacrament of the new law, hinted at indeed in Mark, but recommended and promulgated to the faithful by James the apostle, and brother of the Lord. Is any, he saith, sick among you? Let him bring in the elders of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith shall save the sick; and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him. In which words, as the Church hath learned from apostolic tradition, received from hand to hand, he teaches the matter, the form, the proper minister, and the effect of this salutary sacrament. For the Church hath understood the matter thereof to be oil blessed by a bishop, seeing that the unction most aptly represents the grace of the Holy Ghost, with which the soul of the sick person is invisibly anointed; and furthermore, that those words, “By this unction,” &c. are the form. chapter II On the Effect of this Sacrament Moreover, the thing [signified], and the effect of this sacrament, are explained in those words; And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up, and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him. For this thing is the grace of the Holy Ghost; whose anointing cleanses away sins, if there be any still to be expiated, and the remains of sin; relieves and strengthens the soul of the sick, by exciting in him a great confidence in the divine mercy; whereby the sick being relieved, bears more easily the inconveniences and pains of sickness; and more readily resists the temptations of the devil, who lies in wait for his heel; and sometimes obtains bodily health, when it is expedient for the welfare of the soul. chapter III On the Minister of this Sacrament, and on the Time when it ought to be administered And now, as pertains to the prescribing who ought to receive, and who to administer this sacrament, this also was only obscurely delivered in the words aforesaid. For it is also shown there, that the proper ministers of this sacrament are the elders of the Church; by which name are to be understood, in that place, not the elders by age, or the foremost amongst the people, but, either bishops, or priests by them rightly ordained by the laying on of hands by the presbytery. It is also declared, that this unction is to be applied to the sick, but especially to those who lie in such danger as to seem placed at their departure from this life: whence, also, it is called the sacrament of the departing. But if the sick should recover, after having received this unction, they may again be aided by the succour of this sacrament, when they fall into another like danger of death. Wherefore, they are on no account to be hearkened unto, who, contrary to so manifest and clear a declaration of the apostle James, teach that this unction is either a human figment, or is a rite received from the fathers, which neither hath a command from God, nor a promise of grace: nor those who assert that it hath already ceased, as though it were only to be referred to the grace of healing in the primitive church; nor those who say that the rite and usage which the holy Roman Church observeth in the administration of this sacrament is repugnant to the declaration of the apostle James, and that it is, therefore, to be changed into some other: nor finally, those who affirm that this Extreme Unction may without sin be contemned by the faithful: for all these things are most manifestly at variance with the distinct words of so great an apostle. Neither, assuredly, does the Roman Church, the mother and mistress of all others, Observe aught else in administering this unction, as regards those things which make up the substance of this sacrament, but what the blessed James has prescribed. Nor indeed can the contempt of so great a sacrament be without a heinous sin, and an injury to the Holy Ghost himself. These are the things which this holy œcumenical synod professes and teaches, and proposes unto all the faithful of Christ, to be believed and held, touching the sacraments of Penance and Extreme Unction. But it delivers the following canons to be inviolably observed; and, perpetually condemns and anathematizes those who assert the contrary. On the most holy sacrament of penance",

Bishops shall therefore charge their clerks, of what rank soever they be, that they be a guide unto the people of God committed to them, in discourse, conservation, and knowledge; being mindful of that which is written; Be holy, for I too am holy.

Whereas, therefore, first of all, it hath perceived that the number of suspected and pernicious books, wherein an impure doctrine is contained, and is spread far and wide, has at this season increased to excess, which indeed has been the cause that many censures have been, out of a godly zeal, published in divers provinces, and especially in the mighty city of Rome, and yet that no salutary remedy has availed against this so great and pernicious a disorder; it hath [therefore] thought fit, that fathers specially chosen for this inquiry, should carefully consider what ought of necessity to be done in the matter of censures and of books, and also in due season make a report to this holy synod, to the end that it may itself more easily separate the various and strange doctrines, as tares from the wheat of Christian truth, and may, in regard thereof, more conveniently deliberate and determine what shall seem best suited to remove scruples from the minds of very many, and to remove various causes of complaint. And [the synod] wishes all these matters to come to the cognizance of all persons soever, as by this present decree it doth make them cognizant; to the end that, if any person shall think it in any way concerneth himself, either in this matter of books and censures, or in the other matters which it has before declared are to be treated of in this general council, he may not doubt but that he will be kindly hearkened to by the holy synod. And inasmuch as this said holy synod heartily desires, and earnestly beseeches God for the things that are for the peace of the Church, that we all, acknowledging our common mother upon earth, who cannot forget the sons of her womb, with one mind, with one mouth, glorify God, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; it invites and exhorts, by the bowels of the mercy of the same our God and Lord, all who hold not communion with us, unto concord and reconciliation, and that they come unto this holy synod, and embrace charity, which is the bond of perfectness, and to show forth the peace of Christ rejoicing in their hearts, to the which they are called in one body. Wherefore, in hearing this voice, not of man, but of the Holy Ghost, let them not harden their hearts, but, walking not after their own sense, nor pleasing themselves, let them be excited and turned unto this so charitable and salutary an admonition of their own mother. For, as the holy synod invites, so will it embrace them with all offices of love. Yet further, this same holy synod has decreed, that the public faith may be granted in a general congregation, and that it shall have the same force, and shall be of the same strength and weight, as if it had been given and decreed in a public session. The same sacred and holy Synod of Trent, lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost,—the same legates of the Apostolic See presiding therein,—ordains and decrees, that the next ensuing session be held and celebrated on the Thursday after the most sacred festival of the Ascension of our Lord, which will be on the fourteenth day of the month of May. Safe-conduct granted to the German nation In a General Congregation, on the fourth day of March, 1562 The sacred and holy, œcumenical and general Synod of Trent, lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost,—the same legates of the Apostolic See presiding therein,—pledges faith to all men, that, by the tenor of these presents, it grants and wholly concedes the public faith, and the fullest and most true security, which they call a safe-conduct, to all and each, the priests, electors, princes, dukes, marquises, counts, barons, nobles, soldiers, common people, and to all other men soever, of what state, condition, or quality soever they be, of the province and nation of Germany, and to the cities and other places thereof, and to all other ecclesiastical and secular persons, especially those of the Confession of Augsburg, who shall come, or shall be sent with them to this General Council of Trent, and to those that shall set out, or have already come hither, by what name soever they are entitled, or may be designated, to come freely to this city of Trent, and there to remain, tarry, sojourn, propose, speak, treat of, examine, and discuss any matters whatsoever together with the said synod, and freely to present and set form all things whatsoever may seem fit to them, and any articles whatever, either in writing or by word of mouth, and to explain, confirm, and prove them by the holy Scriptures, and by the words, opinions, and reasons of the blessed fathers, and, if it be needful, even to answer the objections of the general council; and to dispute, or to confer in charity, without any hindrance, with those who may have been chosen by the council, all opprobrium, railing, and contumely being utterly discarded; and, in particular, that the controverted matters shall be treated of in the aforesaid Council of Trent, according to sacred Scripture, and the traditions of the apostles, approved councils, and the consent of the Catholic Church, and the authorities of the holy fathers; this further being added, that they shall not be punished under pretence of religion, or of offences already committed, or that may be committed, in regard thereof; as also, that there shall be no interruption to the divine offices on account of their presence, either upon the journey, or in any place during their progress, stay, or return, or in the city of Trent itself; and that, these matters being concluded or not concluded, whensoever such is their pleasure, or the command and leave of their superiors, if they shall wish, or any of them shall wish, to return to their own homes, they shall forthwith be able, at their good pleasure, to return freely and securely, without any hindrance, obstacle, or delay, without injury done to their property, or to the honour also and persons of their attendants respectively; with the knowledge, however, of those who shall be deputed [hereunto] by the said synod; that so, without guile or fraud, proper care may be taken for their safety. The holy synod also wills, that all clauses soever, which may be necessary and convenient for a full, effectual, and sufficient security in coming, sojourning, and returning, be included and contained, and be accounted as contained, in this public faith and safe-conduct; it also expressly declaring, with a view to their greater security, and the blessing of peace and reconciliation, that if, which far be it! any one, or certain of them, should, either on the journey when coming to Trent, or whilst sojourning at, or returning from that same place, perpetrate or commit any heinous deed, whereby the benefit of this public faith and assurance might be annulled and quashed, wills and grants, that the persons detected in such crime shall be forthwith punished by their own countrymen, and not by others, with a proportionate chastisement and a sufficient amends, which on the part of the synod may justly be approved and commended, the form, conditions, and terms of the safe-conduct remaining wholly uninfringed. It also reciprocally wills, that if, which far be it! any one, or certain of this synod, should, either on the journey, or whilst sojourning at, or returning therefrom, perpetrate or commit any heinous act, whereby the benefit of this public faith and assurance may be violated, or in any way set aside, the persons detected in such crime shall be forthwith punished by the synod itself only, and not by others, with a proportionate chastisement and a sufficient amends, to be justly approved and commended, on the part of the Germans of the Confession of Augsburg, who may be present here at the time, the present form, conditions, and terms of the safe-conduct remaining wholly uninfringed. The said synod also wills, that it be lawful for all and each of the ambassadors to go out of the city of Trent to take the air, as often as shall be convenient or necessary, and to return thither; as also freely to send or despatch their messenger or messengers to any places soever, according as the arrangement of their affairs may require, and to receive the said messengers or messenger, despatches or despatch, as often as shall seem fit to them; so as, however, one or more be associated therewith by those deputed by the council, in order to provide for their safety. And this safe-conduct and these securities shall stand good and endure, both from the time, and during the time that they shall happen to have been received under the care of the said synod, and the protection of its agents; and further, after they have had a sufficient audience, and twenty days having expired since they have themselves asked, or since the council, upon that audience had, shall have given them notice, to return, it will, all guile and fraud being entirely excluded, restore them, with God’s favour, from Trent to that place of safety which each may select for himself. All which things it promises, and in good faith pledges itself, shall be inviolably observed towards all and each of the faithful of Christ, towards all ecclesiastical and secular princes, and towards all other ecclesiastical and secular persons, of whatsoever state and condition they be, or by whatsoever name designated. Yet further, it promises in true and good faith, all guile and deceit being excluded, that the said synod will neither openly nor covertly seek for any opportunity, nor make use of, nor suffer any one to make use of, any authority, power, right, or statute, privilege of laws or canons, or of any councils soever, especially those of Constance and Sienna, under what form soever of words expressed; to the prejudice in any way of this public faith, and most full security, and of the public and free hearing, granted by this said synod to the above-named; as it derogates from the aforesaid in this instance and for this occasion. And if the holy synod, or any member thereof, or of their followers, of what condition, state, or pre-eminence soever, shall, which may the Almighty deign to avert, violate the form and terms of the security and safe-conduct as above set down, in any point or clause soever, and a sufficient amends shall not have forthwith followed, and one that may with reason be approved of and praised by the parties themselves; they may and shall hold the said synod to have incurred all those penalties, which, by law divine and human, or by custom, the violators of such safe-conducts can possibly incur; without any excuse or contradiction in this respect. Extension [of the safe-conduct] to other nations The same sacred and holy synod, lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost,—the same legates a latere of the Apostolic See presiding therein,—grants the public faith, or a safe-conduct, under the same form, and in the same terms, wherein it is granted to the Germans, to all and each of those others, who hold not communion with us in the matters of faith, of whatsoever kingdoms, nations, provinces, cities, and places [they may be], wherein the contrary to that which the holy Roman Church doth entertain, is publicly and with impunity preached, taught, or believed.",

For, although Christ the Lord, in the last supper, instituted and delivered to the apostles, this venerable sacrament in the species of bread and wine; that institution and delivery do not therefore tend thereunto, that all the faithful of the Church be bound, by the institution of the Lord, to receive both species. But neither is it rightly inferred, from that discourse which is in the sixth of John, however according to the various interpretations of holy fathers and doctors it be understood, that the communion of both species was enjoined by the Lord: for He who said, Except ye shall eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye shall have no life in you, also said, He that eateth this bread shall live for ever; and He who said, He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life, also said, The bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world; and, in fine, He who said, He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, abideth in me and I in him, Said, nevertheless, He that eateth this bread shall live for ever.",

And this the apostle seems to have intimated not obscurely, when he says, Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. And indeed it is sufficiently certain that he himself exercised this power, as in many other things, so also in regard of this very sacrament; when, after having ordained certain things touching the use thereof, he says, The rest will I set in order when I come. Wherefore, Holy Mother Church, knowing this her authority in the administration of the sacraments, although the use of both species has, from the beginning of the Christian religion, not been unfrequent, yet, in progress of time, that custom having already been very widely changed, she, induced by weighty and just reasons, has approved of this custom of communicating under one species, and decreed that it was to be held as a law; which it is not lawful to reprobate, or to change at pleasure, without the authority of the Church itself.",

And if we must needs confess, that no other work can be performed by the faithful so holy and divine as this tremendous mystery itself, wherein that life-giving victim, by which we were reconciled unto God the Father, is daily immolated on the altar by the priests; it is also sufficiently clear, that all industry and diligence is to be applied to this end, that it be performed with the greatest possible inward cleanness and purity of heart, and outward show of devotion and piety. Whereas, therefore, either through the wickedness of the times, or through the carelessness and unworthiness of men, many things already seem to have crept in, which are alien from the dignity of so great a sacrifice; to the end that the honour and worship due thereunto may be restored, unto the glory of God and the edification of the faithful people; the holy synod decrees, that the ordinary bishops of places shall diligently take care, and be bound to prohibit and abolish all those things which either covetousness, which is a serving of idols, or irreverence, which can scarcely be separated from impiety; or superstition, the false imitatress of true piety, have introduced. And that many things may be comprised in few words: first, as relates to covetousness, they shall utterly prohibit all manner of conditions and bargains for recompenses, and whatsoever is given for the celebration of new masses; also the importunate and illiberal exactions, rather than requests, for alms, and other things of the like sort, which are but little removed from simoniacal taint, or at all events, from filthy lucre. Furthermore, that irreverence may be avoided, let each, in his own diocese, forbid that any wandering or unknown priest be permitted to celebrate mass. And, moreover, they shall not allow any one who is publicly and notoriously a criminal, either to minister at the holy altar, or to assist, at the sacred services; nor shall they suffer this holy sacrifice to be celebrated, either by any seculars or regulars whatsoever, in private houses, or anywhere, out of the church, and those oratories dedicated solely unto divine worship, and which are to be designated and visited by the said ordinaries; and not then, unless those who are present shall have first declared, by their decently composed external appearance, that they are not present there in body only, but also in mind and devout affection of heart. They shall also keep from the churches all those kinds of music, in which, whether by the organ, or in the singing, there is mixed up anything lascivious or impure; as also all secular actions; vain and therefore profane conversations, all walking about, noise, and clamour; that so the house of God may truly seem to be, and may be called, a house of prayer. Lastly, that no place may be given to superstition; they shall by edict, and under penalties laid down, that priests take care not to celebrate at other than due hours, nor make use of other rites, or other ceremonies and prayers, in the celebration of masses, besides those which have been approved by the Church, and have been received by a frequent and laudable usage. They shall wholly remove from the Church the observance of a fixed number of certain masses, and of candles, as being invented rather by superstitious worship, than by true religion; and they shall instruct the people, what is, and from whom especially is derived, the fruit so precious and heavenly of this most holy sacrifice. They shall also admonish the same people, to repair frequently to their own parish churches, at least on the Lord’s days and the greater festivals. All these things, therefore, that have been summarily enumerated, are in such wise propounded unto all ordinaries of places, as that according to the power given them by this sacred and holy synod, and even delegates of the Apostolic See, they may prohibit, command, reform, and ordain, not only those very things aforesaid, but also whatsoever else shall seem to them to appertain hereunto; and may compel the faithful people inviolably to observe them, by ecclesiastical censures and other penalties, which may be appointed at their pleasure; any privileges, exemptions, appeals, and customs whatsoever, to the contrary notwithstanding.",

Wherefore it by all means becometh clerks called to have the Lord for their portion, so to regulate their life and manners, as that in their dress, gesture, gait, discourse, and all things else, they bear nothing about them but what is grave, moderate, and replete with religiousness; that they avoid even slight faults, which in them would be most grievous; that so their actions may impress all with veneration. Whereas, therefore, the more useful and decorous these things are in the Church of God, so much the more carefully also are they to be observed; the holy synod ordains, that those things which have been elsewhere copiously and wholesomely enacted by the sovereign pontiffs and sacred councils, touching the life, propriety, dress, and learning of clerks, and also touching luxury, feastings, dances, gambling, sports, and all sorts of crimes whatever, as also the secular employments to be [by them] avoided, the same shall hereafter be observed, under the same penalties, or greater, to be imposed at the discretion of the ordinary; nor shall any appeal suspend the execution hereof, as pertains to the correction of manners.

For the sacred Scriptures make open mention not only of priests, but also of deacons; and teach, in the most weighty terms, what things are especially to be attended to in the ordination thereof; and, from the very beginning of the Church, the names of the following orders, and the proper ministrations of each one of them, to wit, those of subdeacon, acolyth, exorcist, reader, and door-keeper, are known to have been in use; though not of equal rank: for the subdeaconship is classed amongst the greater orders by the fathers and sacred councils, wherein also we very often read of the other inferior orders. chapter III That Orders is truly and properly a Sacrament Whereas, by the testimony of Scripture, by apostolic tradition, and the unanimous consent of the fathers, it is clear that grace is conferred by sacred ordination, which is performed by words and outward signs, no one ought to doubt that Orders is truly and properly one of the seven sacraments of the holy Church. For the apostle says, I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the grace of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands. For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of sobriety. chapter IV Touching Ecclesiastical Hierarchy and Ordination But, inasmuch as in the sacrament of Orders, as also in Baptism and Confirmation, a character is imprinted, which can neither be effaced nor taken away; the holy synod with reason condemns the opinion of those, who assert that the priests of the New Testament have only a temporary power; and that those who have once been rightly ordained, can again become laymen, if they do not exercise the ministry of the word of God. But if any one affirm that all Christians indiscriminately are priests of the New Testament, or that are all mutually endowed with an equal spiritual power, he seems to do nothing but confound the ecclesiastical hierarchy, which is as an army set in array; as if, contrary to the doctrine of the blessed Paul, all were apostles, all prophets, all evangelists, all pastors, all doctors. Wherefore, the sacred and holy synod declares that, besides the other ecclesiastical degrees, bishops, who have succeeded unto the place of the apostles, principally belong to this hierarchical order; that they are placed, as the same apostle says, by the Holy Ghost, to rule the Church of God; that they are superior to priests; confer the sacrament of Confirmation; ordain the ministers of the Church; and that they are able themselves to perform very many other things; over which functions the rest of an inferior order have no power. The sacred and holy synod further teaches, that, in the ordination of bishops, priests, and of the other orders, neither the consent, nor vocation, nor authority, whether of the people, or of any secular power or magistrate soever, is required in such wise as that, without this, the ordination is invalid: yea rather it doth decree, that all those who, being only called and instituted by the people, or by the secular power and magistrate, ascend to the exercise of these ministrations, and those who of their own rashness assume them to themselves, are not ministers of the Church, but are to be accounted as thieves and robbers, who have not entered by the door. These are the things which it hath seemed good to the sacred synod to teach the faithful of Christ, in general terms, touching the sacrament of Orders. But it hath resolved to condemn things contrary thereunto, in express and specific canons, in the manner which follows; to the end that all men, with the assistance of Christ, using the rule of faith, may, amidst the darkness of so many errors, more easily be able to recognize and to hold Catholic truth.

      "content": "The same sacred and holy Synod of Trent, pursuing the matter of Reformation, ordains and decrees that the things following be at present decreed. chapter I The Negligence of Pastors of Churches in residing is variously punished: Provision is made for the cure of souls. Whereas it is divine precept enjoined on all, to whom the cure of souls is committed, to know their own sheep; to offer sacrifice for them; and, by the preaching of the divine word, by the administration of the sacraments, and by the example of all good works, to feed them; to have a fatherly care for the poor and for other distressed persons, and to apply themselves to all other pastoral duties; all which [offices] cannot be rendered and fulfilled by those who neither watch over nor stand by their own flock, but, after the manner of hirelings, abandon it; the sacred and holy synod admonishes and exhorts, that, mindful of the divine precepts, and made ensamples to the flock, they feed and rule in judgment and in truth. And lest those things which have been already elsewhere holily and usefully sanctioned, concerning residence, under Paul III., of happy memory, may be wrested to meanings alien from the mind of the sacred and holy synod, as if by force of that decree it were lawful to be absent during five continuous months; the sacred and holy synod, adhering to those [decrees], declares, that all persons who are, under what name and title soever, even though they be cardinals of the holy Roman Church, set over any patriarchal, primatial, metropolitan, and cathedral churches whatsoever, are obliged to personal residence in their own church, or diocese, where they shall be bound to discharge the office enjoined them; and may not absent themselves save for the causes and in the manner below stated. For whereas Christian charity, urgent necessity, due obedience, and the evident utility of the Church, or of the commonwealth, require and demand that some at certain times be absent, this same sacred and holy synod ordains, that these causes of lawful absence are to be approved of in writing by the most blessed Roman Pontiff, or by the metropolitan, or, in his absence, by the oldest resident suffragan bishop, who shall also be bound to approve of the absence of the metropolitan; except when such absence happens on account of some employment and office in the state attached to the bishoprics; the causes of which absence being notorious, and sometimes sudden, it will not be necessary even that these be notified to the metropolitan. To the same, however, it shall belong, conjointly with the provincial council, to judge of the permissions granted by himself, or by his suffragan, and to see that no one abuse that right, and that transgressors are punished with the canonical penalties. Meanwhile let those about to depart remember to make such provision for their sheep, as that, as far as is possible, they may sustain no injury through their absence. But, inasmuch as those who are only absent for a short period, are, according to the expression of the ancient canons, not considered to be absent, in that they are about to return immediately; the sacred and holy synod wills, that that term of absence, whether continuous or interrupted, ought by no means to exceed two, or at most three, months; except for the above-mentioned causes; and that regard be had that it be done from a just cause, and without any detriment to the flock: which, whether it be so, the synod leaves to the conscience of those who withdraw themselves, which it hopes will be religious and timorous; seeing that their hearts are open before God, whose work they are bound, at their peril, not to do deceitfully. In the mean time it admonishes and exhorts the same in the Lord, that, unless their episcopal duties call them to some other part of their own diocese, they on no account be absent from their own cathedral church during the period of the Advent of the Lord, of Lent, the Nativity, of the Lord’s Resurrection, of Pentecost, and of Corpus Christi, on which days especially the sheep ought to be refreshed, and to rejoice in the Lord at the presence of the shepherd. But if any one, which it is to be hoped will never happen, shall be absent, contrary to the regulation of this decree, the sacred and holy synod ordains, that, in addition to the other penalties imposed upon and renewed against non-residents, under Paul III., and the guilt of deadly sin which [such offender] incurs, he acquires no fruits, in proportion to the time of his absence, and that he cannot, even though no other declaration follow, retain them as his with a safe conscience; but that he is bound, or, in his default, his ecclesiastical superior for him, to apply them unto the fabric of the churches, or to the poor of the place; every kind of agreement, or composition as it is called, in regard of ill-gotten fruits, being prohibited, whereby the aforesaid fruits even might be wholly, or in part, restored to him; any privileges soever, granted to any college or fabric, notwithstanding. The same also, both as regards the guilt, the loss of fruits, and the penalties, the sacred and holy synod wholly declares and decrees, in regard to inferior curates, and all others soever who hold any ecclesiastical benefice having cure of souls; in such wise however, as that, whensoever it shall happen that they are absent for a cause that has been first made known to, and approved by, the bishop, they shall leave, with a due assignment of stipend, a suitable vicar, to be approved of by the said ordinary. And they shall not obtain permission to be absent, which is to be granted in writing and gratuitously, beyond a period of two months, except for some weighty cause. And if, after having been cited, even though not personally, by an edict, they shall be contumacious, [the synod] wills, that the ordinaries be at liberty to constrain them by ecclesiastical censures, and by the sequestration and subtraction of fruits, and by other legal remedies, even as far as deprivation; and that the execution hereof shall not be able to be suspended by any privilege soever, license, claim as a domestic, exemption, though even upon the ground of any manner of benefice, by any compact, or statute, even though confirmed by oath or by what authority soever, by any custom, even though immemorial (which is to be looked upon rather as a corruption), or by any appeal, or inhibition, even in the Roman Court, or by virtue of the constitution of Eugenius. Finally, the holy synod commands, that both that decree under Paul III., and this present, shall be published in the provincial and episcopal councils; for it desires that things which so nearly concern the office of pastors, and the salvation of souls, be frequently impressed upon the ears and minds of all men; that so, with God’s help, they may never hereafter be abolished through the injury of time, the forgetfulness of men, or by desuetude.",

And to the that the youths may be the more conveniently trained in the aforesaid ecclesiastical discipline, they shall always at once wear the tonsure and the clerical dress; they shall learn grammar, singing, ecclesiastical computation, and the other liberal arts; they shall be instructed in sacred Scripture; ecclesiastical books; the homilies of the saints; the manner of administering the sacraments, especially those things which shall seem suited unto hearing confessions; and the forms of the rites and ceremonies. The bishop shall take care that they be every day present at the sacrifice of the mass, and that they confess their sins at least once a month; and receive the body of our Lord Jesus Christ, according to the judgment of their confessor; and on festivals serve in the cathedral and other churches of the place. All which, and other things advantageous and needful unto this object, all bishops shall ordain, with the advice of two of the senior and most discreet canons whom themselves have chosen, as the Holy Spirit shall have suggested; and shall make it their care, by frequent visitation, that the same be always observed. The froward, and incorrigible, and the disseminators of evil morals, they shall punish sharply, even, if necessary by expulsion; and, removing all hindrances, they shall carefully attend to whatsoever things appear to tend to preserve and advance so pious and holy an institution. And inasmuch as some certain revenues will be necessary, for raising the fabric of the college, and for paying their salaries to the teachers and servants, and for maintaining the youths, and for other expenses; besides those [funds] which are, in some churches and places, set apart for instructing or maintaining youths, and which are to be hereby looked upon as applied to this seminary under the said charge of the bishop; the same bishops, with the advice of two of the chapter, of whom one shall be chosen by the bishop, and the other by the chapter itself, and also of two of the clergy of the city, the election of one of whom shall in like manner appertain to the bishop, and of the other to the clergy, shall take away a certain part or portion, out of the entire fruits of the episcopal income, and of the chapter, and of all dignities soever, personates, offices, prebends, portions, abbeys, and priories, of what order soever, even though regular, or of what quality or condition soever they may be, and of hospitals which are conferred under title or administration, according to the constitution of the Council of Vienne, which begins Quia contingit; and of all benefices soever, even those belonging to regulars, even if they be under any right of patronage, even if they be exempted, even if they be of no diocese, or are annexed to other churches, monasteries, hospitals, or to any other pious places, even such as are exempted; as also of [the revenues devoted to] the fabrics of churches, and of other places, and likewise of all other ecclesiastical revenues or proceeds soever, even those of other colleges; in which, however, there are not actually seminaries of scholars, or of teachers, for promoting the common good of the church; (for [the synod] wills that such places be exempted,) except in regard of such revenues as may remain superfluous over and above the fitting support of the said seminaries; or of bodies, or confraternities, which in some places are called schools, and of all monasteries, with the exception of the mendicants; also of the tithes in any way appertaining to laymen, out of which ecclesiastical subsidies are wont to be paid, and to the soldiers of any military body, or order, the brethren of Saint John of Jerusalem alone excepted; and they shall apply to, and incorporate with, the said college that portion so deducted, as also certain simple benefices, of what quality and dignity soever they may be, or even prestimonies, or prestimonial portions, as they are called, even before they fall vacant, without prejudice to the divine service, or to those who hold them. And this shall have effect, even if the benefices be reserved or appropriated; nor shall these unions and applications of the said benefices be suspended, or in any way hindered, by the resignation thereof, but shall still in any case have effect, any way in which they may be vacated, even be it in the [Roman] court, and any constitution whatsoever notwithstanding. And they shall be compelled by the bishop of the place, by ecclesiastical censures, and other legal remedies, even by calling in for this purpose, if it shall seem fit, the help of the secular arm, to pay this portion of benefices, dignities, personates, and of all and each the above-named [revenues], not merely on their own account, but also on account of what pensions soever they may chance to have to pay to others, out of the said revenues or fruits, keeping back, however, a sum equivalent to what they have to pay on account of those said pensions: any privileges, as regards all and singular the above-mentioned premises, exemptions, even such as might require a special derogation, any custom, even immemorial, or any appeal and allegation, which might hinder the execution hereof, notwithstanding. But in case it should happen that, by means of the said unions obtaining their effect, or from some other cause, the said seminary should be found to be wholly or in part endowed, then shall the portion, deducted as above from all benefices, and incorporated by the bishop, be remitted, either wholly or in part, as the actual circumstances shall require. But if the prelates of cathedral and other greater churches should be negligent in erecting the said seminary, and in preserving the same, and should refuse to pay their share; it will be the duty of the archbishop sharply to rebuke the bishop, and to compel him to comply with all the matters aforesaid, and of the provincial synod [to rebuke and compel in like manner] the archbishop, and earnestly to take care that this holy and pious work be, wherever it is possible, as soon as possible proceeded with. But the bishop shall annually receive the accounts of the revenues of the said seminary, two deputies from the chapter, and the same number deputed from the clergy of the city, being present. Furthermore, in order that provision may be made for the teaching in schools of this nature at less expense, the holy synod ordains, that bishops, archbishops, primates, and other ordinaries of places, shall constrain and compel, even by the subtraction of their fruits, those who possess any professorships of theology, and others to whom is attached the office of lecturing or teaching, to teach those who are to be educated in the said schools, personally, if they be competent, otherwise by competent substitutes to be chosen by the same professors, and to be approved of by the ordinary. And if, in the judgment of the bishop, they be not fit, they shall nominate another who is fit, all power of appeal being set aside. But should they neglect this, the bishop himself shall depute one. And the aforesaid [masters] shall teach those things which shall seem expedient to the bishop. And, henceforth, those offices, or dignities, which are called professorships of theology, shall not be conferred on any but doctors, or masters, or licentiates in sacred letters or canon law, or on other competent persons, and such as can personally discharge that office; and any provision made otherwise shall be null and void; all privileges and customs soever, even though immemorial, notwithstanding. But if the churches in any province labour under so great poverty, that, in some of them, a college cannot be erected; the provincial synod, or the metropolitan, with the two oldest suffragans, shall take care to erect one or more colleges, as shall be judged convenient, in the metropolitan church, or in some other more convenient church of the province, out of the revenues of two or more churches, in which singly a college cannot conveniently be established, where the youths of those churches shall be educated. But in churches which possess ample dioceses, the bishop may have one or more seminaries in the diocese, as shall seem expedient to him; which shall however be entirely dependent in all things on the one erected and established in the [episcopal] city. Lastly, if, either upon occasion of the said unions, or the taxation, or assignment, and incorporation of the said portions, or from some other cause, any difficulty should happen to arise by reason of which the institution, or maintenance of the said seminary may be hindered or disturbed, the bishop, with the deputies as above, or the provincial synod, according to the custom of the country, shall have power, according to the character of the churches and benefices, to regulate and order all and each the matters which shall seem necessary and expedient for the advancement of the said seminary, even so as to modify or enlarge them, if need be. Yet further, the same sacred and holy Synod of Trent indicts the next ensuing session for the sixteenth day of the month of September; in which it will treat of the sacrament of Matrimony, and of such other matters, if there be any, relative to the doctrine of faith, as can be expedited, as also touching provisions for bishoprics, dignities, and other ecclesiastical benefices, and divers articles of Reformation. The session was prorogued until the eleventh day of November, mdlxiii.",

      "content": "The Form prescribed in the Council of Lateran for solemnly contracting Marriage is renewed. Bishops may dispense with the Banns. If any one contracts Marriage otherwise than in the presence of the Parish Priest and of Two or Three Witnesses, it comes to nothing. Although it is not to be doubted, that clandestine marriages, made with the free consent of the parties contracting, are valid and true marriages, so long as the Church has not rendered them invalid; and consequently, that those persons are justly to be condemned, as the holy synod doth condemn them with anathema, who deny that such marriages are true and valid; as also those who falsely affirm that marriages contracted by the children of a family, without the consent of their parents, are invalid, and that parents can make such marriages either valid or invalid; nevertheless, the holy Church of God has, for most just reasons, at all times detested and prohibited them. But, whereas the holy synod perceives that those prohibitions, by reason of men’s disobedience, no longer avail; and whereas it takes into account the grievous sins which arise from the said clandestine marriages, and especially the sins of those parties who continue in a state of damnation, when, having left their former wife, with whom they had privily contracted marriage, they publicly marry another, and live with her in perpetual adultery; an evil which the Church, which judges not of things hidden, cannot rectify, unless some more efficacious remedy be applied; therefore, treading in the footsteps of the sacred Council of Lateran, celebrated under Innocent III., it ordains that, for the future, before a marriage is contracted, it shall three times be announced publicly in the church, by the proper parish priest of the contracting parties, during the solemnization of mass, on three continuous festival days, between whom marriage is to be celebrated; after which banns being published, if there be no lawful impediment opposed, the marriage shall be proceeded with in the face of the church; where the parish priest, after having questioned the man and the woman, and having learnt their mutual consent, shall either say, “I join you together in matrimony, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;” or shall use other words, according to the received rite of each province. But if there should at any time be a probable suspicion that the marriage may be maliciously hindered, if so many publications of banns have preceded it; in this case either one publication only shall be made; or at least the marriage shall be celebrated in the presence of the parish priest, and of two or three witnesses. Then, before the consummation thereof, the banns shall be published in the church; that so, if there be privily any impediments, they may the more easily be discovered: unless the ordinary shall himself judge it to be expedient, that the publications aforesaid be dispensed with, which the holy synod leaves to his prudence and judgment. Those who shall attempt to contract marriage otherwise than in the presence of the parish priest, or of some other priest by permission of the said parish priest, or of the ordinary, and in the presence of two or three witnesses; them doth the holy synod render utterly incapable of thus contracting, and declares such contracts void and null, as by the present decree it declares them void and annuls them. Yet further, it enjoins that the parish priest, or any other priest, who shall have been present at any such contract with a less number of witnesses [than aforesaid]; as also the witnesses who have been present thereat without the parish priest, or some other priest; and, also, the contracting parties themselves; shall be severely punished, at the discretion of the ordinary. Furthermore, the same holy synod exhorts that the married couple do not live together in the same house until they have received the sacerdotal benediction, which is to be received in the church; and it ordains that the benediction shall be given by their own parish priest, and that permission to bestow the aforesaid benediction cannot be granted by any other than the parish priest himself, or the ordinary; any custom, even though immemorial, which is rather to be called a corruption, or any privilege, notwithstanding. And if any parish priest, or any other priest, whether he be regular or secular, shall dare to unite in marriage the betrothed of another parish, or to bless them [when married], without the permission of their parish priest, he shall, even though he may contend that he is allowed to do this by a privilege, or an immemorial custom, remain by the very act suspended, until he be absolved by the ordinary of that parish priest who ought to have been present at the marriage, or from whom the benediction ought to have been received. The parish priest shall have a book, which he shall keep carefully by him, in the which he shall register the names of the parties married, and of the witnesses, and the time and place of the marriage being contracted. Finally, the holy synod exhorts those who marry, that, before they contract, or, at all events, three days before the consummation of marriage, they carefully confess their sins, and approach piously to the most holy sacrament of the Eucharist. If any provinces have herein in use any praiseworthy customs and ceremonies, besides the aforesaid, the holy synod earnestly desires that they by all means be retained. And lest these so wholesome injunctions be unknown to any, it enjoins on all ordinaries, that they, as soon as they are able, take care that this decree be published and explained to the people in every parish church of their respective dioceses; and that this be done as often as possible during the first year; and afterwards, as often as they shall judge it to be expedient. It decrees, furthermore, that this decree shall begin to have its effect in each parish at the expiration of thirty days, to be reckoned from the day of its first publication made in the said parish.",

The parish priest, before that he proceeds to confer baptism, shall carefully inquire of those whom it may regard, what person or persons they have chosen to receive from the sacred font the person baptized, and he shall allow him or them only to receive him, and shall register their names in the book, and teach them what relationship they have contracted, lest they have any excuse on the plea of ignorance. And if any others, besides those designated, should touch the baptized, they shall not in any respect contract a spiritual relationship; constitutions that tend to the contrary notwithstanding. If, through the fault or negligence of the parish priest, anything be done contrary hereto, he shall be punished at the discretion of the ordinary.

Wherefore, the holy synod, that it may by opportune remedies provide against this so great an married, of what state, dignity, and condition soever they may be, if, after they have been thrice admonished on this subject by the ordinary, even according to the duties of this office, they shall not have put away their concubines, and have separated themselves from connection with them, they shall be smitten with excommunication; from which they shall not be absolved until they have really obeyed the admonition given. But if, neglectful of these censures, they shall continue in concubinage during a year, they shall be proceeded against with severity by the ordinary, according to the character of the crime. Women, whether married or single, who live publicly with adulterers or with concubinaries, if, after having been thrice admonished, they shall not obey, shall be rigorously punished, according to the measure of their guilt, by the ordinaries of the places, according to the duties of their office, even though no one should call upon them [to do so]; and they shall be cast out from the city or diocese, if it shall seem fit to the ordinaries, the aid of the secular arm being called in, if need be; the other penalties inflicted on adulterers and concubinaries remaining in their proper force.",

Wherefore, seeing it is a thing especially wicked to violate the liberty of matrimony, and that wrongs proceed from those from whom right is expected, the holy synod enjoins on all, of what degree, dignity, and condition soever they may be, under pain of anathema to be incurred by the very act, that they do not in any way constrain, directly or indirectly, those subject to them, or any others soever, so as to hinder them from freely contracting marriage.",

For the state and order of the whole household of the Lord will totter, if what is required in the body be not found in the head. Hence, although the holy synod has elsewhere usefully ordained certain things touching those to be promoted to cathedral and superior churches, yet doth it account this office to be of such a nature, as that were men to ponder upon it in proportion to its greatness, there would never seem to have been caution enough taken. Wherefore it ordains, that, as soon as a church shall become vacant, supplications and prayers shall be made in public and private; and such shall be enjoined, by the chapter, throughout the city and diocese; that thereby both clergy and people may be able to obtain from God a good pastor. And as regards all and each of those who have, in any way, any right from the Apostolic See, or who otherwise have their part in the promotion of those to be set over [churches]; the holy synod, without making any change herein, from a consideration of present circumstances, exhorts and admonishes them, that they above all things be mindful that they cannot do anything more advantageous to the glory of God, and the salvation of the people, than if they study to promote good pastors, and such as are competent to govern a church; and that they commit a deadly sin, becoming partakers in other men’s sins, unless they take diligent care that those be set over [the churches], whom they themselves judge most worthy and most useful to the church, not being guided by entreaties, or human affection, or the solicitations of canvassers, but by what the merits of the persons themselves demand at their hands; and that they be persons whom they know to have been born in lawful wedlock, and who, by their life, age, learning, and all other qualifications, are such as are required according to the sacred canons, and the decrees of this Synod of Treat. And insomuch as, by reason of the diversity of nations, people, and manners, a uniform system cannot be adopted everywhere, in receiving the grave and competent testimony of good and learned men touching the aforesaid qualifications, the holy synod commands, that, in a provincial synod, to be held by the metropolitan, there shall be prescribed for each place and province a proper form of examination, scrutiny, or information, such as shall seem to be most useful and convenient for the said places, to be approved by the discretion of the most holy Roman Pontiff; yet so, however, that, after that this examination or scrutiny, as concerns the person to be promoted, shall have been completed, it shall, after having been reduced into the form of a public document, be by all means transmitted, as soon as possible, with the whole attestation and profession of faith made by him, to the most holy Roman Pontiff, to the end that the said Sovereign Pontiff, having a full knowledge of the whole matter and of the persons, may, to the advantage of the Lord’s flock, in a more useful manner provide for the churches out of their number, if, by examination or scrutiny, they shall have been found competent persons. And all the scrutinies, informations, attestations, and proofs, of what kind soever, and by whomsoever made, even though in the Roman court, touching the qualifications of the person to be promoted, shall be diligently examined by a cardinal, who shall be bound to report thereon to the consistory, and by three other cardinals; and the said report shall be confirmed by the signature of the cardinal who gave the report, and of the three other cardinals; in the which the four cardinals shall each make affirmation that, after bestowing diligent attention thereon, he has found the persons to be promoted, endowed with the qualifications required by law, and by this holy synod, and that, at the peril of his eternal salvation, he doth certainly consider them competent to be placed over the churches; in such wise that, after the report has been made in one consistory, to the end that the said inquiry may be more maturely considered in the mean time, the sentence shall be deferred until another consistory, unless it shall seem expedient to the most blessed Pontiff to act otherwise. And [the synod] decrees, that all and each of the particulars which have been elsewhere ordained, in the same synod, touching the life, age, learning, and other qualifications of those who are to be promoted to be bishops, the same are also to be required in the creation of cardinals of the holy Roman Church, even though they be deacons; whom the most holy Roman Pontiff shall, as far as can conveniently be done, choose out of all the nations of Christendom, as he shall find persons competent. Finally, the same holy synod, moved by the so many most grievous difficulties of the Church, cannot avoid calling to mind, that nothing is more necessary for the Church of God than that the most blessed Roman Pontiff apply especially here to that solicitude, which, by the duty of his office, he owes to the Universal Church; that he take unto himself, to wit as cardinals, men the most select only, and that he set over each church, above all things, good and competent pastors; and this the more, for that our Lord Jesus Christ will require at his hands the blood of those sheep of Christ which shall perish through the evil government of pastors who are negligent, and forgetful of their office.",

Metropolitans, however, even after having completely visited their own proper diocese, shall not visit the cathedral churches, or the dioceses of the bishops of their province, except for a cause known and approved of in the provincial council. But archdeacons, deans, and other inferiors, shall henceforth visit those churches, in which they have been hitherto accustomed lawfully to exercise visitations; but by themselves only, with the consent of the bishop, and assisted by a notary. The visitors also who may be deputed by a chapter, where the chapter has the right of visitation, shall first be approved by the bishop; but the bishop, or, if he be hindered, his visitor, shall not thereby be prevented from visiting those same churchesa part from them; and the said archdeacons, and other inferiors, shall be bound to give [the bishop] an account, within a month, of the visitation that has been made, and to show him the depositions of witnesses, and the entire proceedings; any custom, even though immemorial, and any exemptions and privileges soever, notwithstanding. But the principal object of all these visitations must be to introduce sound and orthodox doctrine, by banishing heresies; to maintain good morals, and to correct evil ones; to incite the people, by exhortations and admonitions, unto religion, peace, and innocence; and to establish such other things as, according to the prudence of the visitors, shall seem for the profit of the faithful, as time, place, and opportunity shall allow. And to the end that all these matters may have a more easy and prosperous issue, all and each of the aforesaid, whom the right of visitation concerns, are admonished that they treat all persons with fatherly tenderness and Christian zeal; and therefore being content with a modest train of horses and servants, they shall strive to complete the said visitation as speedily as possible, yet with due diligence. And they shall meanwhile be careful not to be grievous or burthensome to any one by any useless expenses; and neither they, nor any of theirs, shall, by way of agency fee for the visitation, or, on account of wills made for pious uses, except that which is due to them of right out of pious bequests, or under any other name soever, receive anything, either money, or present, of what kind soever, or in what way soever offered; any custom, even though immemorial, notwithstanding; with the exception, however, of food, which shall be furnished frugally and in moderation to them and theirs, only during the necessary period, and no longer. It shall, however, be at the option of those who are visited, to pay, if they prefer it, in a fixed assessment of money, what they have been heretofore accustomed to pay, or to furnish the food aforesaid; saving also the right of ancient conventions entered into with monasteries, or other pious places, or churches not parochial, which shall remain inviolate. But, in those places or provinces, where it is the custom that neither food, nor money, nor anything else be received by the visitors, but that all be done gratuitously, the same shall there be retained. But if any one, which far be it, shall presume to receive anything more than is prescribed in any of the cases above mentioned; besides the restitution of double the amount, to be made within a month, he shall also be mulcted, without any hope of pardon, in the other penalties contained in the constitution of the general Council of Lyons, which begins, Exigit; as also in the other penalties [enacted] in the provincial synod, at the discretion of that synod. But patrons shall not presume in any way to interfere in those things which regard the administration of the sacraments; nor shall they mix themselves up with the visitation of the ornaments of the church, or its revenues arising from landed property, or from the rental of buildings, excepting so far as they are competent to do this by the institution, or foundation; but the bishops shall themselves attend to these things, and shall take care that the revenues of those buildings be expended upon purposes necessary and useful for the church, as shall to them seem most expedient.",

No one, therefore, shall henceforth be promoted to any dignities soever, to which the cure of souls is attached, unless he have attained at least to the twenty-fifth year of his age, and, having been practised for some time in the clerical order, is recommended by the learning necessary for the discharge of his office, and by integrity of morals, according to the constitution of Alexander III., promulgated in the Council of Lateran, which begins, Quum in cunctis. Archdeacons also, who are called the eyes of the bishop, shall, in all churches, where it is possible, be masters in theology, or doctors or licentiates in canon law. But, to the other dignities or personates, to which no cure of souls is attached, clerks shall be taken in, who are in other respects competent, and who are not less than twenty-two years of age. Those also who are promoted to any benefices whatsoever having cure of souls, shall, within two months at latest from the day of obtaining possession, be bound to make public profession of their orthodox faith in the presence of the bishop himself, or, if he be hindered, before his vicar-general, or official; and shall promise and swear that they will continue in obedience to the Roman Church. But those who are promoted to canonries and dignities in cathedral churches, shall be bound to do the same not only before the bishop, or his official, but also in the chapter; otherwise all those promoted as aforesaid shall not render the fruits their own; nor shall possession avail them. Nor shall they henceforth receive any one to a dignity, canonry, or portion, but him who has either already been initiated into the sacred order which that dignity, prebend, or portion requires, or is of such an age as to be capable of being initiated into that order, within the time ordained by law and by this holy synod. But as regards all cathedral churches, all canonries and portions shall be attached to the order of the priesthood, deaconship, or subdeaconship; and the bishop, with the advice of the chapter, shall designate and distribute, as it shall seem to be expedient, to which [therefore] each of those respective holy orders is for the future to be annexed; in such wise, however, that one-half at least shall be priests, but the rest deacons, or subdeacons. But where the more praiseworthy custom requires, that the greater part, or all, be priests, it shall by all means be observed. Moreover, the holy synod exhorts that, in provinces where it can conveniently be done, all the dignities, and at least one-half of the canonries, in cathedral and eminent collegiate churches, be conferred only on masters, or doctors, or even on licentiates in theology, or canon law. Furthermore, it shall not be lawful, by force of any manner of statute or custom soever, for those who possess, in the said cathedral or collegiate churches, any dignities, canonries, prebends, or portions, to be absent from those said churches, above three months in each year; saving, however, the constitutions of those churches which require a longer term of service. Otherwise every one shall, for the first year, be deprived of one half of the fruits which he has made his own by reason even of his prebend and residence. But, if he again display the same negligence, he shall be deprived of the fruits which he may have gained during that same year; and, the contumacy increasing, such [offenders] shall be proceeded against according to the constitutions of the sacred canons. As regards the distributions, however; those who have been present at the stated hours shall receive them; the rest shall, all collusion and remission soever being set aside, forfeit them, according to the decree of Boniface VIII., which begins, Consuetudinem, which the holy synod again calls into use; any statutes or customs soever to the contrary notwithstanding. And all shall be compelled to perform the divine offices in person, and not by substitutes; as also to attend on and serve the bishop when celebrating [mass], or performing any other pontifical functions; and reverently, distinctly, and devoutly to praise the name of God, in hymns and canticles, in the choir instituted for psalmody. They shall, furthermore, at all times make use of a becoming dress, both in and out of church; shall abstain from unlawful hunting, hawking, dancing, taverns, and games; and abound in such integrity of manners, as that they may with justice be called the senate of the Church. As to the other matters, which regard the fitting manner of conducting the divine offices, and the proper way of singing or chanting therein, the fixed regulations for assembling and remaining in choir, as also such things as may be necessary in regard of all the ministers of the church, and any other matters of the like kind; the provincial synod shall prescribe a fixed form on each subject, considering the utility and habits of each province. But, in the meantime, the bishop,—with not less than two canons, one of whom shall be chosen by the bishop, the other by the chapter,—shall be able to provide herein as may seem to be expedient.",

Insomuch as very many cathedral churches have so slight a revenue, and are so small, that they by no means answer to the episcopal dignity, nor suffice for the necessities of the churches; the provincial council, having summoned those whose interests are concerned, shall examine and diligently weigh, what churches it may be expedient, on account of their narrow extent and their poverty, to unite to others in the neighbourhood, or to augment with fresh revenues; and shall send the documents prepared touching the aforesaid to the Sovereign Roman Pontiff, and the Sovereign Pontiff; being thereby informed, shall, of his own prudence, as he may judge to be expedient, either unite together the poor churches, or improve them by some addition derived from the fruits. But in the meantime, until the aforesaid things are carried into effect, provision shall be made by the Sovereign Pontiff for those bishops who, on account of the poverty of their dioceses, need the aid of fruits, out of certain benefices, provided, however, they be not cures, nor dignities, canonries, prebends, nor monasteries in which regular observance is in force, or which are subject to general chapters, or to certain visitors. In parish churches also, the fruits of which are in like manner so small, that they are insufficient to meet the necessary charges, the bishop, if it cannot be managed by a union of benefices, not however those belonging to regulars, shall take care that, by the assignment of first fruits, or tithes, or by the contributions and collections of the parishioners, or in what other way shall seem to him more convenient, as much be amassed as may decently suffice for the necessities of the rector and of the parish. But in whatsoever unions may have to be made, whether for the aforesaid, or for other causes, parish churches shall not be united to any monasteries soever, or abbeys, or dignities, or prebends of a cathedral or collegiate church, or to any other simple benefices, or hospitals, or military orders; and those so united shall again be taken cognizance of by the ordinaries, according to the decree elsewhere made in this same synod, under Paul III., of happy memory, which shall also be equally observed in respect to the unions [made] from that time forth to the present; notwithstanding anyform soever of words which may have been used therein, which shall be accounted as being sufficiently expressed here. Furthermore, all those cathedral churches, the revenue of which, in real annual value, does not exceed the sum of one thousand ducats, and those parish churches where it does not exceed the sum of one hundred ducats, shall not for the future be burthened with any pensions, or reservations of fruits. In those cities and places, likewise, where the parish churches have no certain boundaries, neither have their rectors their own proper people to govern, but administer the sacraments to all promiscuously who seek it, the holy synod commands bishops, that for the more perfect security of the salvation of the souls committed to their charge, having divided the people into fixed and proper parishes, they shall assign to each its own perpetual and peculiar parish priest, who may know his own parishioners, and from whom alone they may lawfully receive the sacraments; or they shall make such other provision as may be more profitable, according as the character of the place may require. And they shall also take care that the same be done, as soon as possible, in those cities and places where there are no parish churches; any privileges and customs, even though immemorial, notwithstanding.",

Whereas the holy synod detests these practices, it enjoins on bishops, that they suffer not anything of this kind to be done, unless [the proceeds thereof] be turned to pious uses, nor permit any of those modes of entering [on benefices] which carry suspicion of a simoniacal taint, or of sordid avarice; and they themselves shall carefully take cognizance of their constitutions, or customs in the matters above mentioned; and, those only being excepted which they approve of as laudable, the rest they shall reject and abolish as corrupt and scandalous. And it decrees that those, who act in any way contrary to the things comprised in this present decree, are liable to the penalties set forth against simoniacs by the sacred canons, and various constitutions of the Sovereign Pontiffs, all which this synod renews; any statutes, constitutions, customs, even though immemorial, even though confirmed by the apostolic authority notwithstanding; the bishop, as the delegate of the Apostolic See, shall have power to take cognizance touching any surreption, obreption, or defect of intention, in regard thereof.",

In what Form and by whom those nominated to Parochial Churches ought to be examined It is most especially expedient for the salvation of souls, to be governed by worthy and competent parish priests. To the end that this may more diligently and rightly be accomplished, the holy synod ordains, that when a vacancy [occurs] in a parish church, whether by death, or by resignation, even in the Roman Court, or in any other manner soever, though it may be alleged that the charge devolves on the church [itself], or on the bishop, and though it may be administered by one or more priests, and this even in the case of those churches called patrimonial, or receptive, in which the bishop has been accustomed to assign the cure of souls to one or more, all of whom [this synod] commands to be subjected to the examination herein prescribed later, even though the said parish church happen to be reserved, or appropriated, whether generally or specially, even by force of an indult, or privilege granted in favour of cardinals of the holy Roman Church, or of certain abbots, or chapters; it shall be the duty of the bishop, at once, upon gaining information of the vacancy of the church, to appoint, if need be, a competent vicar to the same, with a suitable assignment, at his own discretion, of a portion of the fruits, that he may support the duties of the said church, until it be provided with a rector. Moreover, the bishop, and he who has the right of patronage, shall, within ten days, or some other term, to be prescribed by the bishop, nominate, in the presence of those to be deputed as examiners, certain clerks as competent to govern the said church. It shall, nevertheless, be free for others also, who may know any that are fit for that office, to give in their names, that a diligent scrutiny may afterwards be made touching the age, morals, and sufficiency of each. And, if it shall seem more expedient to the bishop, or the provincial synod, according to the custom of the country, those who may wish to be examined may be summoned by a public edict. When the time appointed has transpired, all those who have been entered on the list shall be examined by the bishop, or, if he be hindered, by his vicar-general, and by the other examiners, not fewer than three; to whose votes, if they should be equal, or given to distinct parties, the bishop, or his vicar, may add [their casting vote] in favour of whomsoever they shall think most fit. And as regards the examiners, six at least shall be annually proposed by the bishop, or by his vicar, in the diocesan synod; who shall satisfy, and be approved of by the synod. And upon any vacancy happening in any church, the bishop shall choose three out of that number to make the examination with him; and afterwards, upon another vacancy following, he shall select, out of the six aforesaid, either the same, or three others, whom he may prefer. But the said examiners shall be masters, or doctors, or licentiates in theology, or in canon law, or such other clerks, whether regulars, even of the order of mendicants, or even seculars, as shall seem most competent thereunto; and they shall all swear on the holy Gospels of God, that they will, every human affection set aside, faithfully perform their duty. And they shall beware of receiving anything whatever, either before or after, on account of this examination; otherwise, both themselves and the parties giving [such gratuities] will incur the guilt of simony, from which they shall not be capable of being absolved, until after they have resigned the benefices of which they were possessed in any manner soever, even before; and they shall be rendered incapable of any others for the future. And in regard to all these matters, they shall be bound to render an account, not only before God, but also, if need be, to the provincial synod, by which, at its discretion, if it be ascertained that they have done anything contrary to their duty, they shall be liable to be severely punished. Then, after the examination is completed, report shall be made of all those who shall have been judged, by the said [examiners], competent by age, morals, learning, prudence, and other suitable qualifications, to govern the vacant church. And out of these shall the bishop select him. whom he shall judge more competent than the rest; and to him, and to none other, shall the church be collated by him unto whom it belongs to collate thereunto. But if the church be under ecclesiastical patronage, and the institution [thereunto] belong to the bishop, and not to another, he, whom the patron shall judge the most worthy from amongst those approved of by the examiners, shall be presented to the bishop, that he may be instituted by him. But when the institution is to be made by any other than the bishop, then the bishop alone shall choose the worthiest from amongst the worthy, whom the patron shall present to him whom the institution concerns. But if it be under lay patronage, the person who shall be presented by the patron, must be examined, as above, by those deputed, and not be admitted, unless he be found fit. And, in all the above-mentioned cases, to none other but to one of those who have been examined as aforesaid, and have been approved by the examiners, according to the aforesaid rule, shall the care of the church be committed, nor shall any devolution, or appeal, even interposed before the Apostolic See, or the legates, vice-legates, or nuncios of that same see, or before any bishops, or metropolitans, primates, or patriarchs, hinder or suspend the report of the aforesaid examiners from being carried into execution: for the rest, the vicar whom the bishop has, at his own discretion, already for the time being deputed to the vacant church, or whom he may perhaps afterwards depute thereunto, shall not be removed from the charge and administration of the said church, until it be provided for, either by [the appointment of] the same [vicar], or of another person, who has been approved and elected as above. All provisions or institutions made otherwise than according to the aforesaid form, shall be accounted surreptitious: any exemptions, indults, privileges, preventions, appropriations, new provisions, indults granted to any universities soever, even for a certain sum, and any other impediments soever, in opposition to this decree, notwithstanding. If, however, the said parish churches should possess so slight a revenue, that it allow not of the trouble of all this examination; or should there be no one who seeks to subject himself to this examination; or if, by reason of the open factions, or dissensions, which are found in some places, more grievous quarrels and tumults may easily be excited; the ordinary, omitting this formality, if, in his conscience, with the advice of the [examiners] deputed, it shall seem to be expedient, may have recourse to a private examination, observing, however, the other things as above. It shall also be lawful for the provincial synod, if it shall account that there are any matters to be added to, or retrenched from, the above regulations touching the form of examination, to provide accordingly.",

      "content": "Whereas the Catholic Church, instructed by the Holy Ghost, has, from the sacred writings and the ancient tradition of the fathers, taught, in sacred councils, and very recently in this œcumenical synod, that there is a Purgatory, and that the souls there detained are relieved by the suffrages of the faithful, but chiefly by the acceptable sacrifice of the altar; the holy synod enjoins on bishops that they diligently strive that the sound doctrine touching Purgatory, delivered by the holy fathers and sacred councils, be believed, held, taught, and everywhere proclaimed by the faithful of Christ. But let the more difficult and subtle questions, and those which tend not to edification, and from which for the most part there is no increase of piety, be excluded from popular discourses before the uneducated multitude. In like manner, such things as are uncertain, or which labour under an appearance of error, let them not allow to be made public and treated of. But those things which tend to a certain kind of curiosity or superstition, or which savour of filthy lucre, let them prohibit as scandals and stumbling-blocks of the faithful. And let the bishops take care, that the suffrages of the faithful who are living, to wit, the sacrifices of masses, prayers, almsgivings, and other works of piety, which have been wont to be performed by the faithful for the other faithful departed, be piously and devoutly performed, according to the institutes of the Church; and that what things soever are due on their behalf from the endowments of testators, or in other way, be discharged, not in a negligent manner, but diligently and accurately, by the priests and ministers of the church, and others who are bound to render this service. Touching the invocation, veneration, and on relics of saints, and sacred images The holy synod enjoins on all bishops, and others sustaining the office and charge of teaching, that, according to the usage of the Catholic and Apostolic Church, received from the primitive times of the Christian religion, and according to the consent of the holy fathers, and to the decrees of sacred councils, they especially instruct the faithful diligently touching the intercession and invocation of saints; the honour paid to relics; and the lawful use of images: teaching them, that the saints, who reign together with Christ, offer up their own prayers to God for men; that it is good and useful suppliantly to invoke them, and to resort to their prayers, aid, and help, for obtaining benefits from God, through His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who alone is our Redeemer and Saviour; but that they think impiously, who deny that the saints, who enjoy eternal happiness in heaven, are to be invoked; or who assert either that they do not pray for men; or, that the invocation of them to pray for each of us even in particular, is idolatry; or, that it is repugnant to the word of God; and is opposed to the honour of the one mediator between God and men, Christ Jesus; or, that it is foolish to supplicate, orally, or inwardly, those who reign in heaven. Also, that the holy bodies of holy martyrs, and of others now living with Christ, which were the living members of Christ, and the temple of the Holy Ghost, and which are by Him to be raised unto eternal life, and to be glorified, are to be venerated by the faithful; through which [bodies] many benefits are bestowed by God on men; so that they who affirm that veneration and honour are not due to the relics of saints; or, that these, and other sacred monuments, are uselessly honoured by the faithful; and that the places dedicated to the memories of the saints are vainly visited for the purpose of obtaining their aid; are wholly to be condemned, as the Church has already long since condemned, and doth now also condemn them. Moreover, that the images of Christ, of the Virgin Mother of God, and of the other saints, are to be had and retained particularly in temples, and that due honour and veneration are to be awarded them; not that any divinity or virtue is believed to be in them, on account of which they are to be worshipped; or that anything is to be asked of them; or that confidence is to be reposed in images, as was of old done by the Gentiles, who placed their hope in idols; but because the honour which is shown unto them is referred to the prototypes which they represent; in such wise that by the images which we kiss, and before which we uncover the head, and prostrate ourselves, we adore Christ, and venerate the saints, whose similitude they bear. And this, by the decrees of councils, and especially of the second synod of Nicæa, has been ordained against the opponents of images. And the bishops shall carefully teach this; that, by means of the histories of the mysteries of our Redemption, depicted by paintings or other representations, the people are instructed, and strengthened in remembering, and continually reflecting on the articles of faith; as also that great profit is derived from all sacred images, not only because the people are thereby admonished of the benefits and gifts which have been bestowed upon them by Christ, but also because the miracles of God through the means of the saints, and their salutary examples, are set before the eyes of the faithful; that so for those things they may give God thanks; may order their own life and manners in imitation of the saints; and may be excited to adore and love God, and to cultivate piety. But if any one shall teach or think contrary to these decrees; let him be anathema. And if any abuses have crept in amongst these holy and salutary observances, the holy synod earnestly desires that they be utterly abolished; in such wise that no images conducive to false doctrine, and furnishing occasion of dangerous error to the uneducated, be set up. And if at times, when it shall be expedient for the unlearned people; it happen that the histories and narratives of holy scripture are portrayed and represented; the people shall be taught, that not thereby is the Divinity represented, as though it could be perceived by the eyes of the body, or be depictured by colours or figures. Moreover, in the invocation of saints, the veneration of relics, and the sacred use of images, every superstition shall be removed, all filthy lucre be abolished, finally, all lasciviousness be avoided; in such wise that figures shall not be painted or adorned with a wantonness of beauty; nor shall men also pervert the celebration of the saints, and the visitation of relics, into revellings and drunkenness; as if festivals are celebrated to the honour of the saints by luxury and wantonness. Finally, let so great care and diligence be used by bishops touching these matters, as that there appear nothing disorderly, or unbecomingly or confusedly arranged, nothing profane, nothing indecorous; since holiness becometh the house of God. And that these things may be the more faithfully observed, the holy synod ordains, that it be lawful for no one to place, or cause to be placed, any unusual image in any place, or church, howsoever exempted, except it shall have been approved of by the bishop: also, that no new miracles are to be admitted, or new relics received, unless the said bishop has taken cognizance and approved thereof; who, as soon as he has obtained some certain information in regard of these matters, shall, after having taken advice with theologians, and other pious men, act therein as he shall judge to be agreeable to truth and piety. But if any doubtful, or difficult abuse is to be extirpated; or, in fine, if any more serious question shall arise touching these matters, the bishop, before he decides the controversy, shall await the sentence of the metropolitan and of the bishops of the same province, in a provincial council; yet so, that nothing new, or that has not previously been usual in the Church, shall be decreed, without the most holy Roman Pontiff having been first consulted. Concerning regulars and nuns The same sacred and holy synod, pursuing the subject of Reformation, has thought fit that the things following be ordained.",

For it is not to be doubted, that the rest of the faithful also will be more easily excited to religion and innocence, if they shall see those set over them not fixing their thoughts on the things of this world, but on the salvation of souls, and on their heavenly country. Whereas the holy synod, perceiving that these things are of chiefest importance towards restoring ecclesiastical discipline, admonishes all bishops, that, often meditating within themselves thereon, they show themselves conformable to their office, by their actual deeds, and the actions of their lives; which is, as it were, a kind of perpetual sermon; but, above all, that they so order their whole manners, as that others may from them be able to derive examples of frugality, modesty, continency, and of that holy humility which so much recommends us to God. Wherefore, after the example of our fathers in the Council of Carthage, it not only orders that bishops be content with modest furniture, and a frugal table and diet, but that they also give heed that in the rest of their manner of life, and in their whole house, there appear nothing that is alien from this holy institution, and which does not manifest simplicity, zeal towards God, and entire contempt of vanities. Also, it forbids them to strive to enrich their own kindred or domestics out of the revenues of the church; seeing that even the canons of the Apostles hinder them from giving to their kindred the property of the Church, which belongs to God; but if [their kindred] be poor, let them distribute to them thereof as to poor, but not misapply or waste it for their sakes. Yea, the holy synod, with all earnestness, admonishes them that they completely lay aside all this human and carnal affection towards brothers, nephews, and kindred, which is the seed-plot of many evils against the Church. And what things have been said concerning bishops, the same are not only to be observed by all who hold ecclesiastical benefices, whether secular or regular, each according to the condition of his rank, but [the synod] decrees that it also appertains to the cardinals of the holy Roman Church; for whereas the administration of the universal Church depends upon their advice to the most holy Roman Pontiff, it would seem to be shameful, if they did not at the same time shine so preeminently in virtue and in the discipline of their lives, as deservedly to turn unto themselves the eyes of all men.",

Wherefore the holy synod enjoins on patriarchs, primates, archbishops, bishops, and all others who, of right or custom, ought to be present at the provincial council, that, in the very first provincial synod to be held after the close of this council, they publicly receive all and each of the things that have been defined and ordained by this holy synod; as also that they promise and profess true obedience to the Sovereign Roman Pontiff; and at the same time publicly express their detestation of and anathematize all the heresies which have been condemned by the sacred canons and general councils, and especially by this same synod. And henceforth all those who shall be promoted to be patriarchs, primates, archbishops, and bishops, shall by all means observe the same in the first provincial synod at which they shall themselves be present. And should any one of all the aforesaid refuse, which far be it! the bishops of the same province shall be bound, under pain of the divine indignation, at once to give notice thereof to the Sovereign Roman Pontiff, and shall meanwhile abstain from communion with the said person.

And also if there be any other things that need correction and reformation in the universities aforesaid, they shall be amended and ordained by those whom it regards, for the advancement of religion and of ecclesiastical discipline.

It shall be a Crime for the Civil Magistrates to interfere therein. Although the sword of excommunication is the very sinews of ecclesiastical discipline, and very salutary for keeping the people in their duty, yet is it to be used with sobriety and great circumspection; seeing that experience teaches, that if it be rashly or for slight causes wielded, it is more despised than feared, and produces destruction rather than safety. Wherefore, those excommunications which, after certain admonitions previously made, are wont to be issued with the view, as it is termed, of causing a revelation, or on account of things lost or stolen, shall be issued by no one soever but the bishop; and not then, otherwise than on account of some circumstance of no common kind, and a cause which, having been diligently and very maturely weighed by the bishop, moves his mind. Nor shall he be induced to grant the said excommunications by the authority of any secular person soever, even though a magistrate; but the whole shall be left to his own discretion and conscience, when, considering the circumstances, place, person, or time, he shall himself judge that such are to be resolved on. But as regards judicial causes, it is enjoined on all ecclesiastical judges, of what dignity soever they may be, that, both during proceeding, and in giving judgment, they abstain from ecclesiastical censures, or interdict, whensoever an execution on the person or property can, in each stage of the process, be effected by them of their own proper authority; but in civil causes, which in any way appertain to the ecclesiastical court, it shall be lawful for them, if it shall seem to be expedient, to proceed against all persons soever, even laymen, and to terminate suits, by means of pecuniary fines, which, by the very fact of being levied, shall be assigned to the pious places there existing; or by distress upon the property, or seizure of the person, to be made either by their own or other officers; or even by deprivation of benefices, and other remedies at law. But if the execution cannot be made in this manner, either upon the person or property of the guilty, and there be contumacy towards the judge, he may then, in addition to the other penalties, smite them also with the sword of anathema, at his own discretion. In like manner, in criminal causes, where an execution can, as above, be effected upon the person or property, [the judge] shall abstain from censures. But if there cannot easily be opportunity for that execution, it shall be lawful for the judge to employ the said spiritual sword against delinquents; provided, however, the quality of the offence so require, and after two monitions at least; and even this by public edict. And it shall be a crime for any secular magistrate to prohibit an ecclesiastical judge from excommunicating any one; or to command that he revoke an excommunication issued; under pretext that the things contained in the present decree have not been observed; whereas, the cognizance hereof does not appertain to seculars, but to ecclesiastics. And every excommunicated person soever, who, after the lawful monitions, does not change his mind, shall not only not be received to the sacraments, and to communion and intercourse with the faithful; but if, being bound with censures, he shall, with obdurate heart, remain for a year in the defilement thereof, he may even be proceeded against as suspected of heresy.",

The two deputies shall, however, have but one vote; and either of them may give his vote in accordance with [that of] the bishop. But if, in any proceeding, or in any interlocutory or definitive sentence, they shall both differ from the bishop, they shall in such case, within the term of six days, choose, in conjunction with the bishop, a third person; and should they also differ respecting the election of that third person, the choice shall devolve upon the nearest bishop; and the point whereon they differed shall be decided, according to the opinion with which that third person agrees; otherwise, the proceedings, and what follows thereupon, shall be null, and shall have no effect in law. Nevertheless, in crimes arising from incontinency, whereof mention has been made in the decree concerning concubinaries, as also in the more heinous crimes which require deposition or degradation; where there is apprehension of flight, and where, that judgment may not be eluded, it is necessary to detain the person, the bishop may at first proceed singly to a summary information, and to the necessary detention [of the person]; observing, however, in the rest of the proceedings, the order above laid down. But in all cases regard is to be had to this, that the delinquents be kept in custody in a suitable place, according to the quality of the crime and of the persons. Moreover, there shall everywhere be rendered to bishops that honour which is due to their dignity; and in choir, in the chapter, in processions, and other public transactions, they shall have the first seat, and the place which they themselves shall make choice of, and theirs shall be the chief authority in everything to be done. And if they shall propose anything to the canons to be deliberated on, and the matter treated of be not one which concerns any benefit to them or theirs, they shall themselves convoke the chapter, demand the votes, and decide according to them. But, in the absence of the bishop, this shall be entirely done by those of the chapter, to whom of right or custom it appertains, nor shall the bishop’s vicar be permitted to do it. But in all other things, the jurisdiction and power of the chapter, if any belong thereunto, and the administration of their property, shall be left wholly sound and untouched. But those who do not possess any dignities, and are not of the chapter, they shall all be subject to the bishop in ecclesiastical causes; notwithstanding, as regards the things aforesaid, any privileges accruing even from any foundation; as also any customs, even though immemorial; any sentences, oaths, concordates, which only bind the authors thereof; saving, however, in all things, those privileges which have been granted to universities for general studies, or to the members thereof. But all and each of these things shall not have effect in those churches in which the bishops, or their vicars, by force of constitutions, or privileges, or customs, or concordates, or by any other right soever, have a power, authority, and jurisdiction greater than what is included in the present decree.

But if these hospitals were instituted to receive a certain class of pilgrims, or of infirm persons, or of others; and in the place where the said hospitals are situated, there be no such persons, or very few to be found, it doth moreover command, that the fruits thereof be converted to some other pious use, that may be nearest to their original destination, and the most useful for that time and place, as shall seem to be most expedient to the ordinary, aided by such two of the chapter as may be experienced in matters of business, to be chosen by him; unless it happen that the contrary be expressed, even with reference to this event, in the foundation, or institution thereof; in which case, the bishop shall take care that what was ordained be observed, or, if that be not possible, he shall, as above, provide for the matter in a useful manner. Wherefore, if all and each of the aforesaid persons, of what order soever, and religious body and dignity they may be, even if they be laymen, who have the administration of hospitals, provided, however, they be not subject to regulars where regular observance is in force, shall, after having been admonished by the ordinary, have ceased really to discharge the duty of hospitality, applying all the necessary conditions to which they are bound, they may be compelled thereunto not only by ecclesiastical censures, and other legal remedies, but may also even be deprived for ever of the administration and care of the hospital itself; and others shall be substituted in their place, by those whom this may regard. And the persons aforesaid shall, nevertheless, be bound, in the court of conscience, to the restitution of the fruits which they have received contrary to the institution of the said hospitals; which [restitution] shall not be pardoned them by any remission or composition: nor shall the administration or government of such places be henceforth intrusted to one and the same person longer than for three years, unless it be found to be otherwise provided in the foundation thereof; notwithstanding, as regards all the above-stated matters, any union, exemption, and custom, even from time immemorial, to the contrary, or any privileges or indults soever.",

Even as it is not just to abolish the legitimate rights of patronage, and to violate the pious intentions of the faithful in the institution thereof, so also neither is it to be permitted, that, under this pretence, ecclesiastical benefices be reduced to a state of servitude, as is impudently done by many. To the end, therefore, that fitting reason may be observed in all things, the holy synod decrees, that the title to the right of patronage shall be [derived] from a foundation or endowment; which [title] shall be shown from an authentic document, and the other [proofs] required by law; or, also, by repeated presentations during a course of time of such ancient date that it exceeds the memory of man; or, otherwise, according to the directions of the law. But as regards those persons, or communities, or universities, by which that right is for the most part presumed to have been arrived at rather by usurpation, a fuller and more exact proof shall be required to show a true title; nor shall the proof derived from time immemorial be otherwise of avail in their regard, unless, besides other things necessary for that proof, presentations, even continuous, during the space of at least not less than fifty years, all of which presentations have been carried into effect, shall be proved from authentic writings. All other rights of patronage, in regard of benefices, as well secular as regular, or parochial, or in regard of dignities, or any other benefices soever, in a cathedral or collegiate church; as also faculties and privileges, whether granted so as to have the force of patronage, or, by virtue of any other right soever, to nominate, elect, present to the said [benefices] when they are vacant, excepting the rights of patronage which belong to cathedral churches, and excepting such others as appertain to the emperor, to kings, or to those who possess kingdoms, and to other high and supreme princes who possess the rights of sovereignty within their own dominions, as also those which have been bestowed in favour of places of general studies, shall be understood to be wholly abrogated and made void, together with the quasi possession which is consequent thereupon. And benefices of this kind shall be conferred, as being free, by the collators thereunto; and such appointments shall obtain full effect. Furthermore, it shall be lawful for the bishop to reject the persons presented by the patrons, if they be not competent. But it the institution appertain to inferiors, they shall, nevertheless, be examined by the bishop, according to what has been elsewhere ordained by this holy synod; otherwise the institution made by those inferiors shall be null and void. But the patrons of benefices, of what order and dignity soever they may be, even if they be communities, universities, or any colleges soever, whether of clerks or laymen, shall not in any way, nor for any manner of cause or occasion, interfere in the receiving of the fruits, incomes, or revenues of any benefices soever, even though those benefices be truly, by foundation or endowment, under their right of patronage; but shall leave them to the free disposal of the rector, or of the beneficiary, any custom whatever to the contrary notwithstanding. Nor shall they presume to transfer to others, contrary to the sanctions of the canons, the said right of patronage, by sale, or under any other title soever. If they shall act otherwise, they shall be subjected to the penalties of excommunication and interdict, and shall be by the very fact deprived of the aforesaid right itself of patronage. Moreover, those accessions made by way of union of free benefices with churches subject to the right of patronage, even of laymen, whether those churches be parochial, or benefices of any other kind soever, even such as are simple, or are dignities, or hospitals, in such wise that the free benefices aforesaid are made to be of the same nature with those unto which they are united, and are placed under the right of patronage; such [accessions], if they have not as yet been carried into full effect, as also such as shall henceforth be made, at the instance of any person soever, by what authority soever, be it even apostolic, shall, together with the said unions themselves, be regarded as having been obtained by surreption; notwithstanding any form of words therein employed, or any derogation which may be held as expressed; nor shall [such unions] be any more carried into execution, but the benefices themselves so united, shall, when they fall vacant, be freely conferred as previously. But those accessions, which, having been made within the last forty years, have obtained their effect and a complete incorporation; such shall nevertheless be reviewed and examined by the ordinaries, as the delegates of the Apostolic See; and those which shall have been obtained by surreption, or obreption, shall, together with the unions, be declared invalid, and the benefices themselves shall be separated, and be conferred upon other persons. In like manner also whatsoever rights of patronage over churches, and any other benefices of what kind soever, even dignities previously free, which have been acquired within the last forty years, or that may henceforth be acquired, whether through an increase of the endowment, or in consequence of rebuilding, or from some other like cause, even though with the authority of the Apostolic See, shall be carefully taken cognizance of by the said ordinaries, as delegates as aforesaid; and they shall wholly revoke such [rights of patronage] as they shall find not to have been legitimately established on account of some most evident necessity of the church, or benefice, or dignity; and they shall bring back benefices of this kind to their former state of liberty; without injury, however, to the incumbents thereof, and after having restored to the patrons whatsoever they may have given for this purpose; any privileges, constitutions, and customs, even though immemorial, notwithstanding.",

Otherwise, after the said designation has been made, which the bishops shall straightway transmit to the Sovereign Roman Pontiff, any delegations soever of other judges, made to any others but the above, shall be accounted surreptitious.

To the end, therefore, that the ministers of the Church may be recalled to that continency and integrity of life which becomes them; and that the people may hence the more learn to reverence them, the more pure of life they know them to be: the holy synod forbids all clerks soever to dare to keep concubines, or any other women of whom any suspicion can be entertained, either in or out of their own dwellings, or to presume to have any commerce with them: otherwise they shall be punished with the penalties imposed by the sacred canons, or by the statutes of the churches. But if, having been admonished by their superiors, they shall not refrain from these women, they shall be by the very fact deprived of the third part of the fruits, revenues, and proceeds of all the benefices and pensions whatsoever; which [third part] shall, at the discretion of the bishop, be applied to the fabric of the church, or to some other pious place. If, however, persisting in the same crime, with the same or some other woman, they shall not yet have obeyed a second admonition, not only shall they thereupon forfeit all the fruits and proceeds of their benefices, and their pensions, which shall be applied to the places aforesaid, but they shall also be suspended from the administration of the benefices themselves, for as long a time as the ordinary shall think fit, even as the delegate of the Apostolic See. And if, having been thus suspended, they shall nevertheless not send away those women, or if they shall even have intercourse with them, then shall they for ever be deprived of their ecclesiastical benefices, portions, offices, and pensions of what kind soever, and be rendered thenceforth incapable and unworthy of any manner of honours, dignities, benefices, and offices, until after a manifest amendment of life, it shall seem good to their superiors, for a [just] cause, to grant them a dispensation. But if, after they have once put them away, they shall have dared to renew the interrupted connection, or to take to themselves other scandalous women of this sort, they shall, in addition to the penalties aforesaid, be smitten with the sword of excommunication. Nor shall any appeal, or exemption, hinder or suspend the execution aforesaid; and the cognizance of all the matters above mentioned shall not belong to archdeacons, or deans, or other inferiors, but to the bishops themselves, who may proceed without the noise and the formality of justice, and by the sole investigation of the truth of the fact.

Bishops also, if, which far be it! they abstain not from crime of this nature, and, being admonished by the provincial synod, do not amend, shall be by the very fact suspended; and if they persevere, they shall even be reported by the said synod to the most holy Roman Pontiff, who shall animadvert upon them according to the character of their guilt, even with deprivation, if need be.",

And on this account it admonishes the emperor, kings, republics, princes, and all and each, of what state and dignity soever they be, that, the more abundantly they are adorned with temporal goods, and with power over others, so much the more religiously should they respect whatsoever is of ecclesiastical right, as being commanded by God, and as being under the cover of His protection; and that they suffer not such to be injured by any barons, lords, governors, or other temporal masters, and above all by the immediate officers of the masters themselves; but animadvert severely on those, who obstruct her liberty, immunity, and jurisdiction.

And desiring that the abuses which have crept into these matters, and by occasion of which this excellent name of indulgences is blasphemed by heretics, be amended and corrected, it ordains generally by this decree, that all evil gains for the obtaining thereof, whence a most abundant cause of abuses amongst the Christian people has been derived, be entirely abolished. But as regards the other [abuses], which have proceeded from superstition, ignorance, irreverence, or from what other source soever, since, by reason of the manifold corruptions in the places and provinces where the said abuses are committed, they cannot conveniently be specially prohibited; it commands all bishops, that they, each in his own church, diligently collect all abuses of this nature, and report them in the first provincial synod; that, after the opinions of the other bishops have also been ascertained, they may forthwith be referred to the Sovereign Roman Pontiff, by whose authority and prudence that which may be expedient for the universal Church will be ordained; that thus the gift of holy indulgences may be dispensed to all the faithful, piously, holily, and incorruptly. On choice of food; on fasts, and festival days The holy synod furthermore exhorts, and, by the most holy advent of our Lord and Saviour, conjures all pastors, that, like good soldiers, they sedulously recommend to all the faithful all those things which the holy Roman Church, the mother and mistress of all churches, has ordained, as also those things which, as well in this council as in the other œcumenical councils, have been ordained, and that they use all diligence, to the end that they be observant of all things thereof, and especially of those which conduce to mortify the flesh, such as the choice of food and fasts; as also those which tend to promote piety, such as the devout and religious celebration of festival days; often admonishing the people to obey those set over them, whom they who hear shall hear God as a rewarder, whilst they who contemn them shall feel God himself as an avenger. On the index of books, and the catechism, breviary, and missal The sacred and holy synod, in the second session celebrated under our most holy lord Pius IV., gave commission to certain chosen fathers, that they should consider what ought to be done touching various censures, and books either suspected or pernicious, and to make a report thereon to the said holy synod. Hearing now that the finishing hand has been put to that labour by those fathers; which, however, by reason of the variety and multitude of books cannot be distinctly and conveniently judged of by the holy synod; it enjoins that whatsoever has been by them done shall be laid before the most holy Roman Pontiff, that it may by his judgment and authority be terminated and made public. And it commands that the same be done in regard of the Catechism, by the fathers to whom that work was consigned, and as regards the Missal and Breviary. On the place of ambassadors The holy synod declares, that, by the place assigned to ambassadors, as well ecclesiastics as seculars, whether in session, procession, or in any other acts soever, no prejudice has been created in regard of any amongst them; but that all their own rights and prerogatives, and those of their own emperor, kings, republics, and princes, are uninjured and sound, and continue in the same state as they were before the present council. On receiving and observing the decrees of the council So great has been the calamitousness of these times, and the inverate malice of the heretics, that there has been nothing ever so clear in the statement of our faith, or so surely settled, which they, at the persuasion of the enemy of the human race, have not defiled by some sort of error. For which cause the holy synod hath taken especial care to condemn and anathematize the principal errors of the heretics of our time, and to deliver and teach the true and Catholic doctrine; even as it has condemned, anathematized, and defined. And whereas so many bishops, summoned from the various provinces of the Christian world, cannot be absent for so long a time without great casting away of the flock committed to them, and without universal danger; and whereas no hope remains that the heretics, after having been so often invited, even with the public faith which they desired, and so long expected, will come hither later; and as it is therefore necessary to put an end at length to the sacred council: it now remains for it to admonish in the Lord all princes, as it hereby does, so to afford their assistance as not to permit the things which it has decreed to be corrupted or violated by heretics; but that they be by them and all others devoutly received and faithfully observed. But if any difficulty should arise in regard of receiving those [decrees], or should any things occur, which it does not believe, which require explanation or definition, the holy synod trusts that, besides the other remedies appointed in this council, the most blessed Roman Pontiff will take care that, for the glory of God and the tranquillity of the Church, provision be made for the necessities of the provinces, either by summoning, particularly out of those provinces where the difficulty shall have arisen, those whom he shall deem it expedient, in treating of the said matters; or even by the celebration of a general council, if he shall judge it necessary; or in such other way as shall seem to him most convenient. On reciting, in session, the decrees of the council under Paul III and Julius III Insomuch as, at divers times, as well under Paul III. as under Julius III., of happy memory, many things have, in this sacred council, been ordained and defined touching dogmas and reformation of manners, the holy synod wills that they now be recited and read. They were recited On the close of the council, and on suing for confirmation from our most holy lord Most illustrious lords and most reverend fathers, doth it please you that, to the praise of Almighty God, an end be put to this sacred œcumenical synod? and that the confirmation of all and each of the things which have therein been decreed and defined, as well under the Roman pontiffs Paul III. and Julius III., of happy memory, as under our most holy lord Pius IV., be asked, in the name of this holy synod, by the presidents, and the legates of the Apostolic See, from the most blessed Roman pontiff? Afterwards, the most illustrious and most reverend Cardinal Morone, the first legate and president, blessing the holy synod, said: After having given thanks to God, most reverend fathers, go in peace. Who answered: Amen. Acclamations of the fathers at the close of the council The Cardinal of Lorraine. To the most blessed Pius, pope, and our lord, pontiff of the holy and universal Church, many years and eternal memory. Answer of the Fathers. O Lord God, do Thou very long preserve the most Holy Father unto thy Church, for many years. The Cardinal. To the souls of the most blessed sovereign pontiffs Paul III. and Julius III., by whose authority this sacred general council was begun, peace from the Lord, and eternal glory, and happiness in the light of the saints. Answer. Be their memory in benediction. The Cardinal. Of the Emperor Charles the Fifth, and of the most serene kings, who have promoted and protected this universal council, be the memory in benediction. Answer. Amen, amen. The Cardinal. To the most serene Emperor Ferdinand, ever august, orthodox, and pacific, and to all our kings, republics, and princes, many years. Answer. Preserve, O Lord, the pious and Christian emperor. Oh, Heavenly Emperor, protect earthly kings, the preservers of the right faith. The Cardinal. To the legates of the Apostolic Roman See, and presidents in this synod, many thanks, with many years. Answer. Many thanks: the Lord reward them. The Cardinal. To the most reverend cardinals, and most illustrious ambassadors. Answer. Many thanks; many years. The Cardinal. To the most holy bishops, life, and a happy return to their own churches. Answer. To the heralds of truth, perpetual memory; to the orthodox senate, many years. The Cardinal. The sacred and holy œcumenical Synod of Trent: let us confess its faith; let us ever keep its decrees. Answer. Ever let us confess, ever let us keep. The Cardinal. We all thus believe; we all think the very same; we all, consenting and embracing them, subscribe. This is the faith of blessed Peter, and of the apostles: this is the faith of the fathers: this is the faith of the orthodox. Answer. Thus we believe; thus we think; thus we subscribe. The Cardinal. To these decrees adhering, may we be rendered worthy of the mercies and grace of the first and great supreme priest, Jesus Christ God; our inviolate Lady, the holy mother of God, also interceding, and all the saints. Answer. So be it: so be it. Amen, amen. Cardinal. Anathema to all heretics. Answer. Anathema, anathema. After this, it was enjoined on all the fathers, by the legates and presidents, under pain of excommunication, that, before they departed from the city of Trent, they should subscribe with their own hand to the decrees of the council, or approve thereof by some public instrument; all of whom then subscribed, and they were in number 255; to wit, four legates, two cardinals, three patriarchs, twenty-five archbishops, one hundred and sixty-eight bishops, seven abbots, thirty-nine proctors of absent [prelates] with lawful commission, seven generals of [religious] orders. Praise be unto God It agrees with the original: in faith whereof we have subscribed: I, Angelus Massarelli, bishop of Telesia, secretary of the sacred Council of Trent. I, Marcus Antonius Peregrinus, of Como, notary of the said council. I, Cynthius Pamphilus, clerk of the diocese of Camerino, notary of the said council. Discourse Delivered At The Ninth And Last Session Of The Sacred Council Of Trent Celebrated on two successive days, the third and fourth of December, 1563, Pius IV. being Sovereign Pontiff, by the Reverend Father in God Hieronymus Ragasonus, a Venetian, Bishop of Nazianzum, and Coadjutor at Fama Agosta HEREIN ARE SUMMARILY RECOUNTED ALL THE MATTERS DEFINED IN THE COUNCIL OF TRENT WHICH APPERTAIN UNTO PIOUSLY BELIEVING AND LIVING WELL Hear this, all people; receive it with your ears, all ye who inhabit the earth. The Council of Trent, long since begun, for a season delayed, variously harassed and torn asunder, is, at length, by the great and incredible good-will of all orders and nations, united in its parts, and brought to a close. Most happily, indeed, hath this day dawned upon the Christian people, on which the temple of the Lord, oftentimes disturbed and scattered asunder, is restored and completed, and this only ship, fraught with good things, after the severest and most lasting tempests and billows, is safely lodged in its port. And would that they had been willing to embark with us, for whose sake most especially this very voyage was undertaken, and that they, who had given us this occupation, had been partakers in the construction of the edifice—then, indeed, should we now have had cause for even greater joy. But this happened certainly not through our fault. We made choice of this city, at the very entrance of Germany, aye, almost at the very threshold of their dwelling; we provided no guard for ourselves, lest we should excite any suspicion on their part that the place was not perfectly free; we granted them the public faith, which they had stipulated for themselves; we awaited them here for a long season, nor ceased we even to exhort and entreat, that they should draw nigh to know the true light. Yet, even in their absence, I think, we have sufficiently consulted their interest. For whereas there were two matters, in which medicine was to be applied to their sickening and infirm minds,—one being the doctrine concerning the Catholic and truly evangelical faith, in those matters which are called in question by themselves, and in such as seemed to be opportune at this season, being explained and confirmed; the other, the restoration of ecclesiastical discipline, the corruption of which they affirm was the chief reason of their separation from us;—both these things we, as far as lay in us, have abundantly furnished, according to the exigencies of these times. For, at the commencement, this holy synod (having, according to the praiseworthy custom of our ancestors, made a profession of its faith), to the end that it might lay down, as it were, a foundation for its future proceedings, and might show upon what testimonies and safeguards men must rely in the ordaining of dogmas, did, after the example of the most approved ancient councils, piously and prudently enumerate the books of the Old and New Testaments which are to be received without any hesitation; and, lest any difficulty might arise from various versions, did approve a certain and definite translation from the Greek and Hebrew. Hence, attacking the head and citadel of all heresies, it ordained those things [to be believed] touching the corrupt beginnings of human nature, which truth itself, could it speak, would express. Concerning justification thenceforth (a serious question, and in a wondrous manner opposed both by ancient heretics, and by those of our own time) it laid down definite statements, which should both meet the most pernicious opinions on that head, and by which the manner of thinking rightly was set forth in a wondrous order, and with admirable wisdom, in such wise that the Spirit of God might easily be perceived therein. By this, the most excellent decree within the memory of man, almost all heresies are destroyed, and, even as darkness by the sun, are they dissipated and dispersed, and such brightness and such glory of truth shines forth, that no man can now pretend that he perceiveth not so great a light. An wholesome consideration of the seven divine sacraments of the Church followed; first concerning all, and afterwards of each separately. And herein who does not see, how distinctly, explicitly, copiously, and (which is the head of all) how truly the whole subject of these heavenly mysteries is contained? Who, in so great and so multifarious a doctrine, can in any way doubt what is to be either followed or avoided? Who, in all those matters, will find room or opportunity for erring? Who, in fine, can hereafter doubt concerning the virtue and efficacy of these sacraments, when it is perceived that that grace, which daily, like certain droppings of water, is, by means of those said [sacraments], instilled into the minds of the faithful, was then so abundantly present unto us? To these matters were added decrees touching the sacred and holy sacrifice of the mass, and the communion under both forms, and [the communion] of little children; than which [decrees] nothing is more holy, nothing more useful, so that they may seem to have fallen from heaven, not to have been composed by men. To these a certain doctrine will this day be added, touching indulgences, purgatory, the veneration, invocation, images, and relics of the saints; by which not only will resistance be made to the frauds and calumnies of heretics, but full satisfaction will also be given to the consciences of pious Catholics. These matters, touching the things appertaining to our salvation, which are called dogmas, have been prosperously and happily settled, nor will anything else on that head be expected from us at this season. But whereas, in the administering of certain of the aforesaid matters, there were some points which were not fitly and rightly observed, you, most noble fathers, took most earnest care that they should be treated of purely and holily, and after the manner and ordinance of our ancestors. Thus did ye remove all superstition, all search after gain, all so-called irreverence’ from the divine celebration of masses; ye forbade vagrant, unknown, and sinful priests offering this sacrifice; recalled the use of this most sacred thing from private and profane houses to sacred and religious places; removed effeminate songs and symphonies, walkings to and fro, conversations, and traffic, from the temple of the Lord; and those laws were by you prescribed to each ecclesiastical degree, in such wise that, the order being divinely handed down to them, no opportunity of abusing it can be left. Thus ye have removed certain impediments to matrimony, which seemed to give, as it were, a handle for violating the precepts of the Church; ye have shut off the easy way of obtaining excuse from those who entered into the compact of matrimony in a manner scarcely lawful. What should I say touching stealthy and secret marriages? In truth I so conceive, that if there had been no other causes (which yet were many and most important) for calling together this council, it should certainly have been done on this one account. For whereas this matter regards all, nor is any corner found in the whole orb of the earth, which this plague-spot has not invaded, with reason was care to be taken, that provision for this common evil should be made also by common counsel. By that most prudent and almost divine sanction of yours, O most holy fathers, the occasion of countless and most grievous offences and wickednesses has been entirely removed, and the wisest provision made for the government of the Christian commonwealth. To these matters is to be added an especially useful and necessary interdiction of many abuses touching the subjects of purgatory, veneration of saints, worship of images and relics, and also of indulgences, which seemed to deface and defile the most beautiful aspect of the things aforesaid. But the other part, in which it was necessary to treat of the relaxed and almost falling ecclesiastical discipline, was also most diligently completed and perfected. Hereafter those men will be chosen to fulfil ecclesiastical functions who surpass in virtue, not in ambition, and who may consult the people’s advantage, not their own, and may rather profit than rule over them. The word of God, more penetrating than any two-edged sword, will more frequently and more earnestly be announced and explained. The bishops and those others to whom the cure of souls is committed will be present, and will watch over their flocks, nor will they wander beyond the charge intrusted to them. Privileges will avail no one either for living in a state of uncleanness and crime, or for teaching evilly and perniciously; no crime will be left without punishment, no virtue without reward. Excellent provision has been made for the multitude of poor and mendicant priests; each man will be assigned to a certain church and appointed office, whence he may be able to be supported. Avarice, than which no vice is more deadly, especially in the house of God, is absolutely abolished therefrom; all the sacraments will, as is meet, be conferred gratuitously. Out of one church several, out of several one, according as the advantage and state of the people shall demand, will be formed. Those who quest for alms, who, by seeking after their own interest, not after the things of Jesus Christ, brought great damage, great disgrace upon our religion, will—which must be put in the place of extreme happiness—be utterly rooted out of the whole memory of men. Hence our present calamity took its rise; hence the infinite evil ceased not to glide and flow wider and wider daily, nor could it hitherto be met by the cautions and provisions made by many councils. Who, therefore, will not say that it has most wisely been brought to pass, that this member, in the healing of which long and great trouble has been spent in vain, should be cut off? Moreover, worship will be offered unto God in a more pure and correct manner; and they who bear the Lord’s vessels will be cleansed, that they may draw others to imitate them. For which it was most excellently devised, that they who were to be initiated into holy orders should in each church be instructed in such morals and letters from their earliest years, that it might be as it were a seminary of all virtues. But now, the provincial synods being restored, the visitations renewed, for the benefit of the people, not for complaint and expense; the power being delivered unto pastors of more conveniently governing and feeding their own; public penance being brought back to use; hospitality enjoined both on ecclesiastical persons and on pious places; a memorable and almost heavenly system laid down respecting conferring priesthoods having cure [of souls]; plurality (as it is called) of benefices removed; the hereditary possession of the sanctuary of God prohibited; the manner of excommunication imposed and determined; the first trials being assigned to those places where the quarrels arise; duelling interdicted; a certain curb, as it were, which cannot easily be shaken off, being imposed upon the luxury, avarice, and licentiousness of all men, especially in holy orders; kings and princes being admonished of their duty, and other matters of this kind most prudently ordained, who does not see that you, most excellent fathers, have fulfilled your parts in this affair to the fullest extent? In former councils measures have been taken touching the explanation of our faith and the correction of morals, but I know not whether ever more diligently and distinctly. Here, especially during this two last years, we have had [assembled] not only the fathers, but the ambassadors of all people and nations, in which the truth of the Catholic religion is acknowledged. And what men! If we consider their learning, most erudite; if their experience, most skilled; if their intellects, most penetrating; if their piety, most religious; if their life, most innocent. Such also was the number, that, if the present straits of the Christian world be considered, this synod appears to be more numerous than any of those which have been held heretofore. Here were the individual wounds of all laid open, here was their conversation of life exposed, nought was dissembled. The arguments and reasons of our adversaries were treated of in such a manner, that their cause, not ours, then seemed to be the one at stake. Some matters were discussed a third and even a fourth time; the dispute was often carried on with the greatest contention, with that design, forsooth, that as gold by the fire, so might the strength and sinews of truth be approved by certain struggles, as it were, of truth. For what discord could exist between those who were of one mind, and who regarded one object? Since matters stand thus, although (as I said at the beginning) it were greatly to be wished that these things could have been treated of in the presence of those on whose account they have chiefly been discussed; nevertheless, such provision has been made for the safety and health of those absent, that it would seem that, had they been present, provision could have been made in no other manner. Let them humbly, as becometh a Christian man, read what we have ordained touching our faith, and, if any light shall shine upon them, let them not turn away their faces; and, if they have heard the voice of the Lord, let them not harden their hearts; and, if they wish to return to the common embrace of Mother Church, from which they have torn themselves, let them not doubt that all clemency and mercy will be afforded them. But that, most august fathers, is the chiefest mode of conciliating the minds that dissent from us, and of retaining those who consent in faith and duty, if those things which we have in this place ordained in words, we ourselves exhibit practically in our own churches. Laws, although they be the best, are yet a dumb thing. What availed the Hebrew people the laws given by the mouth of God himself? What advantage did the laws of Lycurgus bring to the Lacedæmonians, of Solon to the Athenians, in retaining the liberty on account of which they were written? But wherefore do I call to mind foreign and too ancient things? What instructions or precepts for living well and happily can or ought we to lack, besides the life and teaching of Christ our Lord alone? What, moreover, was omitted by our ancestors, appertaining both to thinking rightly or doing gloriously? Long since, indeed, we had a salutary medicine composed and prepared; but, if it has to expel a disease, it must be taken, and through the veins diffused throughout the whole body. Let us, dearest [brethren], for the first time be drunken with this cup of salvation, and let us be living and speaking laws, and, as it were, a rule and canon to which the actions and studies of others may be directed; and let each man so persuade himself, that nothing will turn out to the advantage and dignity of the Christian republic, except he earnestly contribute all in his own power. That was both before to be our care, and will hereafter be so, with yet more accuracy. For if, after the example of our Master and Saviour, we ought to do before we teach; what excuse can there be, but that we should do after we have taught? Who will be able to bear with or endure us, if, after we have shown that theft is not to be committed, we ourselves be guilty of theft? if, [when we have shown] that fornication is a crime, we [ourselves] be fornicators? Little does it become the holy to dissent from the holy council—the innocent and blameless from the precepts of integrity and innocence—the firm and constant in faith from the established doctrine of our faith. And such, indeed, do our people expect us [to be], who, having long time borne with our absence, consoled themselves with the hope that, when present, we should atone for this concession of time by greater zeal. But that will, as I hope, most holy fathers, be diligently brought about by yourselves; and, as ye have done in this place, so also will ye at home do enough in the sight of God and men. Now (as doth appertain to the present moment), let us first have and offer immortal thanks unto the most mighty and immortal God himself, who hath rewarded us, not according to the sins which we have committed, nor according to our iniquities, but hath, of his own great kindness, granted unto us not only to behold this day, which many have longed to behold, but also to celebrate it with the incredible consent and approbation of the whole Christian people. To Pius IV., our supreme and most excellent pontiff, perpetual and special thanks are next to be acknowledged; who, when first he ascended the seat of the blessed Peter, was inflamed with so great desire of restoring this synod, as to fix all his cares and thoughts thereupon! He forthwith sent nuncios, men of the most approved character, to indict a council to those nations and provinces concerning whose especial salvation it was called together. These passed through almost every district of the north—asked, entreated, conjured, promised all friendly things, and even contrived to pass over into England. Afterwards, when he was unable, as he had most earnestly desired, to be present at the synod, he sent his legates, men most surpassing in piety and learning, two of whom (whose memory is blessed) he willed to be present here on the appointed day, although scarcely any bishops had assembled. These, and a third shortly after added to them, for two months and more, unoccupied, waited at this place for a number of bishops sufficient to form the council, while, in the interim, the Pontiff himself was doing and meditating nought else, but that as many and as excellent fathers, and as soon as possible, might come hither, and that all the kings and princes of the Christian name might send their ambassadors hither, to the end that this, the most weighty and most great common cause of all, might be debated with the common votes and counsel of all. And what did he afterwards omit, either in care, anxiety, or expense, that in any manner seemed to appertain to the magnitude, freedom, and convenience of this council? O the singular piety, and prudence of our pastor and father! O the supreme happiness of him under whose authority and auspices this council, so long tossed about and disturbed, now stands still and is at rest! Upon you, Paul III., upon you, Julius, now dead, I call, to witness how long and with how great earnestness ye longed to behold what we behold! how many expenses, how many labours ye bestowed for that purpose! Wherefore, most holy and blessed Pius, we truly and with our genuine feelings congratulate thee, because the Lord (which is the greatest proof of the divine goodwill towards thee) hath reserved so great joy for thee, so great a praise for thy name. Him do we, suppliant with all prayers and vows, beseech that he will with all haste restore thee, and for as long a time as possible preserve thee safe, for the advantage and honour of his holy Church. We ought also, with the best reason, to return thanks and congratulations to our most serene emperor. He, representing the disposition, as he did the place, of the most powerful Cæsars, who burned with a certain wondrous desire to propagate the Christian religion, preserved this city free from all danger, and by watchfulness contrived that we should enjoy a safe and tranquil peace, and, by the presence, and almost by the pledge, of three of his legates, most excellent men, inspired great feeling of safety in our minds. He, in his surpassing piety, was wondrously anxious on this our behalf. He laboured greatly to draw forth men from the most misty darkness in which they were dwelling, and to lead them to behold the most brilliant light of this holy synod. Yet further, the especially pious goodwill of the Christian kings and princes in adorning this council with their most important embassies, and in submitting their insignia of state to your authority, is to be cherished by grateful remembrance on our part. But now who is there, most illustrious legates and cardinals, who does not confess that he is much indebted to you? Ye have been the best leaders and regulators of our actions. You have, with incredible patience and diligence, taken care lest our liberty, either in speaking or in decreeing should in any respect be infringed. You have spared no labour of body, no exertion of mind, to the end that the matter might as quickly as possible be brought to the wished-for result, which many others like you had vainly striven to attain. In which matter you, most illustrious and accomplished Morone, ought to have a certain chief and particular joy, who, when thou hadst laid the first stone for this most famous edifice twenty years ago, dost now, after many other architects have given their efforts to this work, happily, in thy supreme and almost divine wisdom, put the last stroke to this work. This great and peculiar deed of thine will be celebrated by the perpetual discourse of all, nor will any age ever be silent concerning these thy praises. What shall I say concerning you, most holy fathers, how well, by these most surpassing deeds, ye have deserved of the Christian republic? How great will be the commendation attached to the name of each of you, how great glory will be awarded you by the whole Christian people! All will acknowledge and celebrate you as truly fathers, truly pastors; to you will every man most willingly refer the life and salvation received. O day most pleasant and joyous for our people, on which it shall befall them first to again behold us, and embrace us on our return from building up the temple of the Lord! But, O thou Lord our God, grant that we, by great deeds, may answer to so excellent an opinion concerning us, and that this seed, which thou hast sown in thy field, may bring forth abundant fruit, and that thy word may flow like dew; and, that that which thou hast sometime promised should be, may take place in our times, that there be one fold, and one shepherd over all, and that he may most especially be Pius IV., unto the everlasting glory of thy name. Amen. SECOND PART COMPRISING VARIOUS MATTERS REGARDIND THE COUNCIL OF TRENT Confirmation of the council We, Alessandro di Farnese, cardinal-deacon of Saint Lawrence in Damaso, vice-chancellor of the holy Roman Church, do certify and attest, that, on this day, being Wednesday, the twenty-sixth of January, 1564, in the fifth year of the pontificate of our most holy lord Pius IV., by the providence of God, Pope, the most reverend my lords the Cardinals Morone and Simonetta, lately returned from the sacred Council of Trent, whereat they had presided as legates of the Apostolic See, did, in a secret consistory, held at St. Peter’s, petition our said most holy lord as follows: Most blessed Father; in a decree concerning the closing of the œcumenical Council of Trent, published the day before the nones of December last, it was ordained, that, through the legates and presidents of your Holiness, and of the holy Apostolic See, confirmation should be requested from your Holiness, in the name of the said council, of all and each of the said things which were therein decreed and defined, as well under Paul III. and Julius III., of happy memory, as under your Holiness. Wherefore, we, John, Cardinal Morone, and Louis, Cardinal Simonetta, who were then legates and presidents, wishing to execute what was settled in that decree, do humbly petition in the name of the said œcumenical Council of Trent, that your Holiness would vouchsafe to confirm all and each of the things which have therein been decreed and defined, as well under Paul III. and Julius III., of happy memory, as under your Holiness. Upon hearing which, his Holiness, having regarded and read the tenor of the said decree, and having taken the votes of the most reverend lords the cardinals, replied in these words: Acceding to the petition made to us by the legates aforesaid, in the name of the œcumenical Council of Trent, touching the confirmation thereof, We, with apostolic authority, and with the counsel and assent of our venerable brethren the cardinals, having previously held mature deliberation with them, do confirm all and each of the things which have been decreed and defined in the said council, as well under Paul III. and Julius III., of happy memory, as during the time of our pontificate; and we command that the same be received and inviolably observed by all the faithful of Christ; In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. So it is. A. Cardinal Farnese, Vice-Chancellor. Bull of our most holy lord Pope Pius fourth, by the providence of God TOUCHING THE CONFIRMATION OF THE ŒCUMENICAL (AND) GENERAL COUNCIL OF TRENT Pius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for the perpetual memory hereof. Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort, who, having vouchsafed to look down upon His holy Church, agitated and harassed by so many storms and tempests, and whilst it was every day more grievously distressed, hath at length given relief thereunto by a suitable and wished for remedy. To extirpate very many and most pernicious heresies, to correct manners, and to restore ecclesiastical discipline, to procure the peace and concord of the Christian people, an œcumenical and general council had been, a long time since, indicted by our predecessor, Paul III., of pious memory, and had been begun by holding several sessions. Having been by his successor recalled to the same city, the council, after several sessions had been celebrated, could not, on account of various impediments and difficulties which occurred, be even then brought to a conclusion: it was, therefore, for a long time interrupted, not without the greatest grief on the part of all pious persons, whilst the Church daily more and more implored that remedy. But we, after having entered upon the government of the Apostolic See, undertook to accomplish so necessary and salutary a work, even as our pastoral solicitude admonished us; with confidence in the Divine mercy, and aided by the pious earnestness of our most beloved son in Christ, Ferdinand, emperor elect of the Romans, and by that of other Christian kings, republics, and princes, we have at length attained to that which we have not ceased to toil for by daily and nightly cares, and which we have assiduously besought of the Father of lights. For whereas a most numerous assembly of bishops and of other distinguished prelates, and one worthy an œcumenical council, had, upon being convoked by our letters, and impelled also by their own piety, assembled together from all sides out of the nations of Christendom, at the said city; besides very many other persons of piety, men pre-eminent for skill in sacred letters, and knowledge of divine and human law; the legates of the Apostolic See presiding in the said synod; ourselves so favourable to the liberty of the council, that we, even by letters written to our legates, had voluntarily left the said council free to determine touching matters properly reserved for the Apostolic See; such things as remained to be treated of, defined, and ordained, touching the sacraments and other matters, which seemed to be necessary for confuting heresies, abolishing abuses, and amending morals, were by the sacred and holy synod, with the greatest liberty and diligence, treated of, and accurately and with the utmost deliberation defined, explained, and ordained. Which things being completed, the council was brought to a close with so great unanimity on the part of all who assisted thereat, that it was evident that such agreement was brought about by the Lord, and it was very wonderful in our eyes, and those of all. For which so singular a gift of God, we straightway indicted solemn processions in this noble city, which were celebrated with great piety by the clergy and the people; and we took care that the thanksgivings so justly due should be paid to the divine majesty; forasmuch as the issue of that council has brought with it a great and almost certain hope that greater fruits will daily be derived unto the Church from the decrees and constitutions thereof. And whereas the said holy synod, in its reverence towards the Apostolic See, and adhering also to the footsteps of the ancient councils, has, in a decree made on that subject, in public session, requested of us the confirmation of all its decrees, passed in our time and that of our predecessors; We being acquainted with the request of the said synod, first by the letters of our legates, then, after their return, by what they diligently reported in the name of the synod; after mature deliberation held thereon with our venerable brethren, the cardinals of the holy Roman Church; and, above all, having invoked the assistance of the Holy Spirit; after that we had ascertained that all those decrees were Catholic, and useful and salutary to the Christian people, We, to the praise of Almighty God, with the counsel and assent of our brethren aforesaid, have this day, in our secret consistory, confirmed by apostolic authority all and each of those decrees, and have ordained that the same be received and observed by all the faithful of Christ; as also, for the clearer information of all men, We do, by the tenor of this letter, confirm them, and ordain that they be received and observed. Moreover, in virtue of holy obedience, and under the penalties appointed by the sacred canons, and others more grievous, even those of deprivation, to be inflicted at our discretion, We do also command all and each of our venerable brethren, the patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, and all other prelates soever of the churches, of what estate, grade, order, and dignity soever they may be, even though they be distinguished with the honour of the cardinalate, that they observe diligently the said decrees and statutes in their churches, cities, and dioceses, both within and without their courts of justice, and that they cause the same to be inviolably observed, each by his own subjects, in so far as in any way concerns them; silencing gainsayers and the contumacious, by means of the sentences, censures, and ecclesiastical penalties also contained in the said decrees; even calling in, if need be, the help of the secular arm. And, by the bowels of the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, We admonish and conjure our said most beloved son the emperor elect, and the other Christian kings, republics, and princes, that with the same piety with which they assisted, by their ambassadors, at the council, with that same piety and equal zeal, for the sake of the divine honour, and the salvation of their people, in reverence also of the Apostolic See, and the sacred synod, to support, when there be need, with their aid and countenance, the prelates in executing and observing the decrees of the said council; and that they do not permit opinions adverse to the sound and salutary doctrine of the council to be received by the people under their sway, but utterly interdict them. Furthermore, in order to avoid the perversion and confusion which might arise, if each one were permitted, as he might think fit, to publish his own commentaries and interpretations on the decrees of the council; We, by apostolic authority, forbid all persons, as well ecclesiastics, of what order, condition, and rank soever they may be, as laymen, with what honour and power soever invested; prelates to wit, under pain of being interdicted from entering the church, and all others, whosoever they be, under pain of excommunication incurred by the fact, that they presume, without our authority, to publish, in any form, any commentaries, glosses, annotations, scholia, or any kind of interpretation soever touching the decrees of the said council; or to settle anything in regard thereof, under any plea soever, even under pretext of greater corroboration of the decrees, or the execution thereof, or under any other colourable pretext soever. But if anything therein shall seem to any one to have been expressed and ordained obscurely, and it shall, on that account, appear to stand in need of an interpretation or decision, let him go up to the place which the Lord hath chosen; to wit, to the Apostolic See, the mistress of all the faithful, whose authority the holy synod also has so reverently acknowledged. For if any difficulties and controversies shall arise touching the said decrees, We reserve them to be by us explained and decided, even as the holy synod has itself in like manner decreed; being prepared, as that [synod] has justly expressed its confidence in regard of us, to provide for the necessities of all the provinces, in such manner as shall seem to us most convenient; decreeing that whatsoever may be attempted to the contrary touching these matters, whether wittingly or unwittingly, by any one, by what authority soever, is, notwithstanding, null and void. And to the end that these things may come to the knowledge of all men, and that no one may be able to use the excuse of ignorance; We will and ordain, that in the Vatican Basilica of the prince of the apostles, and in the Lateran church, at the time when the people is wont to assemble there in order to be present at the solemnization of masses, these letters be publicly read in a clear tone by certain officers of our court; and that after they have been read, they be affixed to the doors of those churches, and also to the gates of the Apostolic Chancery, and to the usual place in the Campo di Fiore; and be left there for some time, to be read by, and to come to the knowledge of all men. But when they shall be removed thence, copies being, according to custom, left in those same places, they shall be committed to the press in our noble city, that so they may more conveniently be made known throughout the provinces and kingdoms of the Christian name. And we command and decree, that without any doubt, faith be given to copies thereof, which are written or subscribed by the hand of a public notary, and guaranteed by the seal and signature of some person constituted in ecclesiastical dignity. Let it be lawful, therefore, for no one to infringe this our letter of confirmation, admonition, inhibition, reservation, will, mandate, and decree, or with rash daring go contrary thereunto. But if any one shall presume to attempt this, let him know that he will incur the indignation of Almighty God, and of his blessed apostles Peter and Paul.

The Bull of Our Sacred Lord Pius, by Divine Providence Fourth Pope TOUCHING THE DECLARATION OF THE TIME TO OBSERVE THE DECREES OF THE SACRED ŒCUMENICAL AND GENERAL COUNCIL OF TRENT Pius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to the perpetual memory hereof. As the authority and confirmation of the Apostolic See both ought, and is wont to ratify the decrees and canons of the sacred councils; so, any doubt which may have arisen regarding them is to be removed by the judgment and declaration of the same see. It has reached our ears, that there are many who entertain doubts from what period the decrees of the sacred general Council of Trent, those at least regarding reform and positive law, began to be binding on those to whom they appertain, those of them especially which preordain certain times for holding provincial and diocesan synods, for undertaking holy orders, for making religious profession, for resigning parish churches and other ecclesiastical benefices, the retention of which has been forbidden by the decrees of the same council, and for the execution of several matters of this kind, and all other matters regarding the aforesaid reform and positive law only, as to what ought to be observed or avoided. To the end, therefore, that all controversy and doubt may be removed, we have thought fit, of our own proper motion, that this matter should be clearly set forth, even as we deemed to be agreeable to reason, law, and equity. For though the decrees of the council itself, even according to the counsel and assent of our venerable brethren the cardinals of the holy Roman Church, were confirmed by us in our secret consistory towards the end of the month of January, and even from that time began to be observed at this Holy See; because, however, not a little time was necessarily consumed in printing them carefully and correctly at Rome, and it was also ratified by common right, that the new constitutions should not possess their full force until after a certain period,—it seemed to us meet and just, that all the aforesaid decrees, those at least regarding the said reform and positive law, had commenced to be binding on all from the calends of last May, and that after that day the excuse of no one soever, that he was ignorant of them, is to be admitted: and accordingly we declare and define by apostolical authority, and we command and ordain that it ought to be judged so by all; decreeing as null and void any contrary judgment held by any other person, no matter what station, authority, and power he may possess; any apostolical constitutions and ordinations and other regulations to the contrary notwithstanding. Be it lawful, therefore, for no person soever to infringe this page of our declaration, definition, mandate, statute, and decree, or by rash presumption to contravene it. But if any one shall presume to attempt it, be it known to him that he will incur the indignation of Almighty God, and of his blessed apostles Peter and Paul. Given at Rome, at St. Peter’s, in the year of the incarnation of our Lord 1564, on the 15th of the calends of August, the fifth year of our pontificate. Fed. Card. Caesius, Cae. Glorierius. H. Cumyn. Registered before Cæsar, Secretary, in the year from the nativity of our Lord 1564, on the seventh indiction, on the 20th day of the month of July, in the fifth year of the pontificate of our most holy father in Christ, and of our lord, Lord Pius, by divine providence Pope IV., the rescript letter was affixed, read, and published on the doors of the palaces of the prince of the apostles, and of Saint John of Lateran, and likewise of the Apostolic chancery, and in the Campo di Fiore, by us James Carra, and Julius Parinus, ushers of our holy lord the Pope. Antonius Clerici, Master of the Ushers. Motus Proprius of Our Holy Lord Pius, By Divine Providence Fourth Pope EIGHT CARDINALS ARE DEPUTED TO ENFORCE THE OBSERVANCE OF THE CONSTITUTIONS AND ORDINANCES SET FORTH BY PIUS IV., AS ALSO THE DECREES OF THE SACRED ŒCUMENICAL AND GENERAL COUNCIL OF TRENT Pius IV., pope. Of our own proper motion, &c. We have elsewhere issued some other constitutions and ordinances, concerning the reformation of the pœnitentiarius major and of our sacred penitentiary, of our vicar, and of his office, as also of the chamberlain and the apostolic chamber, and of the causes assigned to that auditor, and also of the auditors of the causes of the apostolic palace, and of the governor, and of the courts of the Capitol, and of the courts of appeal and other tribunals of our noble city, and of the Roman court, which, however (as we have ascertained), are not observed with sufficient care by the prefects and officials of the said officers and tribunals. But whereas it is our most earnest wish, that those, and in like manner the decrees of the sacred Council of Trent, should be absolutely observed by the same in those matters regarding their offices: for that reason we, considering that it is not enough to grant laws, unless there be those who may take care that they be put in force, and in the matters aforesaid, even as we are bound by what is due to the pastoral office enjoined on us (how undeserving soever we may be), to take wholesome and use useful precautions, and wishing that the aforesaid constitutions and ordinances, and decrees of the council, such as we here wish them to be held as expressly indicated, be inviolably observed: we commit and intrust to our venerable brethren, [the cardinals] John Morone, bishop of Tusculum, John Michael Saracenus, of St. Anastasia, Giovanni Battista Cicada, of St. Clement, Michael Alexandrinus, of St. Sabina, Clement of Saint Mary in Ara Cœli, Louis Simoneta, of St. Cyriacus at Thermæ, Carlo Borromœus, of Saint Martin on the Mounts, all priests, and further to Vetellotius, cardinal-deacon of Saint Mary in the portico of Vitellius, to the end that they themselves, or the majority of them, conjointly or separately, by their free will, and even as executors of the aforesaid letters, constitutions, and decrees, may cause the constitutions and ordinances and decrees aforesaid, according to their tenor, and that of the letters sent forth to this effect, to be observed steadfastly and effectually, through all the judges and officials of the courts of penitentiary, vicariate, of the chambers and the aforesaid tribunals, under the penalty of excommunication to be thereby incurred, and deprivation of offices, and other such [penalties] as may seem fit to the same cardinals, even pecuniary mulcts to be incurred by the same fact (unless in the execution as well of the aforesaid decrees of the council, as of our letters already mentioned, some doubt or difficulty shall have arisen, in which case they may refer to us), even the aid of the secular arm being called in, if need shall be, and let them take care, announce, decree and declare, as we by these presents denounce, decree, and declare, that those who shall not comply with the aforesaid letters and decrees, and the commands of the same cardinals, from the present time, as from the same day, being deprived of such offices, and also considered as unfit in future to obtain those and other offices of the Roman court, and they themselves being thus deprived of the offices, [let them take care, announce, decree, and declare, as we do,] that those offices being vacant by privation, be sold by our datarius, and may be purchased freely and lawfully by any proper persons soever at a suitable price, by our authority; notwithstanding any constitutions and apostolical ordinances soever, and the statutes of the penitentiary, and courts, as also of the aforesaid tribunals, even though strengthened by an oath, &c.; [notwithstanding also] all privileges, indults, and apostolic letters granted to them, and to the aforementioned officials and tribunals under any tenor or forms soever, and with what clauses, and decrees soever, even by a motus proprius or after any other manner. By all which, &c., we this time most absolutely abrogate their tenor, &c., and we desire that they should not be, by any means, valid in opposition to what is here set forth. Thus it seems good to us by our first special motion. Given at Rome, at Saint Mark’s, on the 4th nones of August, in the fifth year. The Bull of Our Holy Lord, the Lord Pius, by Divine Providence Fourth Pope TOUCHING THE FORM OF THE OATH OF THE PROFESSION OF FAITH Pius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for the perpetual memory hereof. The office of apostolic servitude enjoined on us requires, that those matters, which Almighty God has vouchsafed divinely to inspire into the minds of the holy fathers assembled in his name for the provident guidance of his Church, we should hasten unhesitatingly to execute, unto his praise and glory. Whereas, therefore, according to the resolution of the Council of Trent, all who may happen henceforward to be placed over cathedral and superior churches, or who may have to take care respecting their dignities, canonries, and any other ecclesiastical benefices soever having the cure of souls, are bound to make a public profession of the orthodox faith, and to promise and swear that they will continue in obedience to the Church of Rome: We, willing that the same thing be observed likewise by all persons soever, who shall have the charge of monasteries, convents, houses, and any other places soever, of all regular orders soever, even of military ones, under what name or title soever, and besides, to the end that the profession of one and the same faith be uniformly exhibited by all, and that one only, and a certain form of it be made known unto all, we, [willing] that a want of our solicitude should by no means be felt by any one in this particular, by strictly prescribing the tenor of these presents, we, by virtue of our apostolic authority, command, that the form itself be published, and be received and observed everywhere by those whom it concerns; in consequence of the decrees of the council itself, as well as the other parties aforesaid, and that the aforesaid profession be made solemnly according to this, and no other form, under the penalties enacted by the council itself against all contravening, under the following terms:— I, N. with steadfast faith believe and profess all and every particular contained in the symbol of faith, which the Holy Roman Church uses, to wit: “I believe in one God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible; and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, and born of the Father before all ages, God of God, light of light; very God of very God, begotten not made, consubstantial with the Father; by whom all things were made; who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnated of the Holy Ghost from the Virgin Mary, and was made man; was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, suffered, and was buried; and rose again on the third day according to the scriptures, and ascended into heaven, sitteth at the right hand of the Father, and will again come with glory to judge the living and the dead, of whose kingdom there shall not be an end; and in the Holy Ghost, the Lord, and giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son; who together with the Father and Son is adored and glorified; who spake through the prophets; and one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. I confess one baptism for the remission of sins, and I await the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.” The apostolical and ecclesiastical traditions, and the other observances and constitutions of the same Church, I most steadfastly admit and embrace. I likewise admit the Holy Scripture according to that sense which our Holy Mother Church has held and does hold, whose province it is to judge of the true sense and interpretation of the sacred scriptures. Nor will I ever understand or interpret it, except according to the unanimous consent of the holy fathers. I also profess that there are truly and properly seven sacraments of the new Law instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ, and necessary for the salvation of mankind, though not all necessary to each individual; to wit, Baptism, Confirmation, the Eucharist, Penance, Extreme Unction, Orders, and Matrimony, and that they confer grace, and that of these, Baptism, Confirmation, and Orders cannot be reiterated without sacrilege. I also receive and admit all the received and approved ceremonies of the Catholic Church in the solemn administration of all the above-mentioned sacraments. I embrace and receive all and everything which in the holy Synod of Trent has been defined and declared concerning original sin and justification. I profess likewise that in the Mass is offered to God a true, proper, and propitiatory sacrifice for the living and the dead, and that in the most holy sacrament of the Eucharist there is truly, really, and substantially the body and blood, together with the soul and divinity, of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that there takes place a conversion of the entire substance of the bread into the body, and of the entire substance of the wine into the blood, which conversion the Catholic Church calls transubstantiation. I also confess that under one kind alone, Christ is taken whole and entire, and a true sacrament. I steadfastly hold that there exists a purgatory, and that the souls there detained are assisted by the suffrages of the faithful; in like manner also that the saints reigning along with Christ are to be venerated and invoked, and that they offer up prayers for us, and that their relics are to be venerated. I steadfastly assert that the images of Christ and of the ever Virgin Mother of God, and in like manner of other saints, are to be kept and retained, and that due honour and veneration is to be awarded to them; I also maintain that the power of indulgences has been left by Christ in his Church, and that the use of them is most wholesome to the Christian people. I recognize the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church as the mother and mistress of all churches; and I promise and swear true obedience to the Roman pontiff, successor of St. Peter, prince of the apostles, and vicar of Jesus Christ. All other things also delivered, defined, and declared by the sacred canons and œcumenical councils, and particularly by the holy Synod of Trent, I undoubtingly receive and profess, and at the same time all things contrary, and any heresies soever condemned by the Church, and rejected and anathematized, I, in like manner, condemn, reject, and anathematize. This true Catholic faith, outside of which no one can be saved, which at present I readily profess and truly hold, I, N. promise, vow, and swear, that I will most steadfastly retain and confess the same entire and undefiled to the last breath of life (with God’s help), and that I will take care, as far as shall be in my power, that it be held, taught, and preached by my subjects, or those whose charge shall devolve on me in virtue of my office. So help me God, and these holy gospels of God. But we will that the present letter be read according to custom in our Apostolic chancery. And that they may the more readily be open to all, let them be written out in its Quinternum, and also be printed. Be it, therefore, lawful for no person soever to infringe this page of our will and command, or to contravene it by any rash daring. But if any one shall presume to attempt this, let him know that he will incur the indignation of Almighty God, and of his blessed apostles Peter and Paul. Given at Rome, at St. Peter’s, in the year of the incarnation of our Lord 1564, on the ides of November, and in the fifth year of our pontificate. Fed. Cardinal Caesius. Cae. Glorierius. The above-written letter was read and published at Rome in the Apostolic chancery, in the year of the incarnation of our Lord 1564, on the Sabbath, 9th of the month of December, in the fifth year of the pontificate of our most holy father and lord in Christ, Pius IV. Pope. A. Lomellinus, Custos. Bull of Our Holy Lord Pius IV., By Divine Providence Pope THE PRIVILEGES, EXEMPTIONS, IMMUNITIES, FACULTIES, DISPENSATIONS, CONSERVATORIES, INDULTS, ETC., TO WHAT PLACES AND PERSONS SOEVER CONCEDED, IN THOSE PARTICULARS WHEREIN THEY ARE AT VARIANCE WITH THE STATUTES AND DECREES OF THE HOLY COUNCIL OF TRENT, ARE REVOKED Pius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, for the perpetual memory hereof. Appointed to the see of the prince of the apostles, how inferior soever in deserts, we can do nothing either more wholesome for the universal Church committed unto our care and solicitude, or more becoming the office of the apostolic service enjoined on us, than [to take care that] the œcumenical Council of Trent, as it has, chiefly under our auspices, terminated happily, and amid the greatest unanimity of the holy fathers, through the mercy of God, so by the ministry of our care it may be everywhere received by all who are reputed for Christian piety, and, all obstacles removed, be equally observed by all. Whereas, therefore, very many decrees and statutes of a wholesome nature, and extremely conducive to the universal reformation of morals, have been put forth in the said council, preceded by the matured examination of those present, to which many and different privileges, exemptions, immunities, dispensations, faculties, conservatories, indults, and confessionals, as they call them, and the great sea, and other graces, which have been granted to various cathedral, metropolitan, as well as to collegiate churches, monasteries, convents, and other religious houses and orders, even to those of mendicant brethren, and also to those of the Holy Ghost in Saxia, of St. John of Lateran, and of the Incurables of the City, of St. Anthony of Vienna, and of St. Bernard of Jura, and other hospitals, military orders, and their chapters and convents, and universities, even to colleges of general studies, as well secular as ecclesiastic, to confraternities, societies, and as well to buildings of the prince of the apostles of the city, as to other manufactories, those of the holy cross, and other pious places and works, as also to patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, prelates, abbots, abbesses, priors, provosts, and to other ecclesiastics as well seculars as regulars of different orders and military services, and even to lay persons of what dignity and state and degree soever, and of distinction, and also to persons of both sexes distinguished by ducal, royal, and imperial dignity, and also to some notaries, and also to legates de latere and nuncios, as well perpetual as temporary, by several Roman pontiffs our predecessors, and ourselves and the Apostolic See and its legates, even by our own proper motion, and with the certain knowledge and out of the fulness of the apostolic power, or even with the contemplation and in the sight of emperors, kings, dukes, and other princes, in various ways, and at different periods, generally or specifically, under any even fair pretext, and also have been confirmed or renewed several times, are in most particulars opposed: We, to whom it is especially at heart, that so holy and most wholesome decrees of the Church of God should, as is meet, everywhere obtain their due effects, and be observed obediently by all, holding by these presents as sufficiently expressed and fully inserted, the tenor of the privileges, exemptions, immunities, faculties, conservatories, indults, confessionals, the great sea, and the other graces aforesaid, and of all apostolic and other letters soever drawn up thereon, and of processes and decrees and whatever else have followed from them, as if they were inserted word for word, by our proper motion, and from our certain knowledge, and from the fulness of the apostolic power, by the apostolic authority, by the tenor of these presents declare, and even decree and ordain, that the same privileges, all and every one of the exemptions, immunities, faculties, dispensations, conservatories, indults, confessionals, the great sea, and other graces in each and every point in which they are at variance with the statutes and decrees of the council, are by right revoked, made null and void, and reduced to the terms and limits of the council itself, and should be considered as such, and that nothing is in any respect to support them in opposition to the decrees and statutes themselves, so that they should not be observed everywhere and among all, but that they ought to be held and accounted as though they had never gone forth. Decreeing, nevertheless, that all and every one of those particulars which were transacted and done in any manner soever, and shall for the future be done by virtue of privileges, exemptions, immunities, and dispensations, faculties, conservatories, indults, confessionals, and any other boons soever of this kind, after the time when the council began to be binding, are and are deemed to be, null, void, and invalid in those points in which they are opposed to the decrees of the aforesaid council, and that they can and ought to support no one, however circumstanced or qualified he may be, as well in the forum fori, as they say, as in the forum conscientiæ, and that it ought to be so judged and defined in both forums by all the ordinaries of the several places whatsoever, and the other judges and commissaries whatsoever exercising authority, likewise by the cardinals of the holy Roman Church, the power of judging otherwise being taken, from them, and from any of them, and whatever may happen knowingly or ignorantly to be attempted by any one, of what authority soever, we decree to be null and void; notwithstanding what may have preceded, and the apostolic constitutions and ordinances, and other contrary [enactments]. Wherefore let it be lawful for no one soever to infringe this page of our declaration, statute, ordinance, and decree, or by rash daring to contravene it. But if any one shall presume to attempt this, let him know that he will incur the indignation of Almighty God, and of his blessed apostles Peter and Paul.

In the year from the nativity of our Lord 1565, on the 6th indiction, on the 24th day of February, in the sixth year of the pontificate of our most Holy Father in Christ and our lord Pius IV., by divine providence Pope, the apostolic rescript was affixed and published in the Campo di Fiore, and on the doors of the Apostolic chancery, by us, Niccolo de Mattheis and Camillo Cherubini, ushers of our holy lord the Pope. Philibertus Phapuis, Master of the Ushers. Concerning prohibited books Ten rules drawn up by the fathers selected by the synod of Trent and approved by pope Pius IV Rule I Let all the books which before the year 1515 were condemned, whether by the sovereign pontiffs or by œcumenical councils, and are not in this index, be considered to be condemned after the same manner as they were formerly condemned. Rule II The books of arch-heretics, as well of those who invented or excited heresies after the year above mentioned, as of those who are or were the heads or leaders of heretics, such as Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin, Balthazar, Pacimontanus, Swenchfeldius, and such like, of what name, title, or argument soever, are utterly prohibited. And the books of other heretics, such as professedly treat of religion, are altogether condemned. But such as do not treat of religion are permitted, after having been examined and approved by Catholic theologians, by order of the bishops and inquisitors. But Catholic books written as well by those who have afterwards fallen into heresy, as by those who after falling have returned to the bosom of the Church, being approved by the theological faculty of some Catholic University or by a general inquisition, may be permitted. Rule III Versions also of ecclesiastical writings, which have hitherto been set forth by condemned authors, provided they contain nothing against sound doctrine, are permitted. But versions of the books of the Old Testament may be allowed only to learned and pious men at the discretion of the bishop, provided they use such versions as elucidations of the Vulgate to understand the sacred scripture, but not as the sound text. But let versions of the New Testament, made by authors of the first class of this index, be allowed to no one, because but little utility, but very much danger is to flow from their perusal. But if any annotations are made public with such versions as are permitted, or with the Vulgate edition, the suspected passages being expunged by the theological faculty of any Catholic University, or by a general inquisition, they may be allowed to the same persons, to whom the versions also [were permitted]. On which conditions the entire volume of Biblia, which is commonly called the Bible of Vatablus, or parts of it, may be granted to pious and learned men. But, from the Bible of Isidore, let the prologue and prolegomena of Clarius Brixianus be cut out; but let no one consider the text of it as the text of the Vulgate edition. Rule IV Whereas it is evident from experience, that, if the sacred books be permitted in the vulgar tongue indiscriminately, more harm than utility arises therefrom by reason of the temerity of men, in this respect let it depend on the discretion of the bishop or inquisitor, so that with the counsel of the parish priest or the confessor, they can grant to them the reading of the books translated by Catholic authors in the vulgar tongue, such persons as they may consider may derive not injury, but an increase of faith and of piety from such reading; which power they may have with respect to the scriptures. But whosoever shall presume to read them without such power, let him not be able to obtain absolution of his sins, unless he has first given back the books to the ordinary. But the booksellers, who shall sell the Bible written in the vulgar tongue, to a person not having the aforesaid power, or shall in any other way grant it, is to lose the price of the books, which shall be converted by the bishop to pious purposes, and they shall be subject to other penalties, according to the quality of the offence, at the discretion of the same bishop. But regulars are not to have the power of reading or buying them, unless they have power to do so from their prelates. Rule V Those books, which sometimes come forth as the works of heretical authors, in which they set down little or nothing of their own, but collect the words of others; such as lexicons, concordances, apophthegms, similes, indexes, and such like, should they contain any matter mixed with them, which may require expurgation, those matters being first taken away or corrected by advice of the bishop or inquisitor together with the advice of Catholic theologians, may be permitted. Rule VI Books treating in the vulgar idiom of controversies between Catholics and the heretics of our time, are not to be allowed indiscriminately; but let the same thing be observed with regard to them as has been ordained respecting Bibles written in the vulgar tongue. But there is no reason why books written in the vulgar tongue on the subject of living well, of contemplating, confessing, and such subjects, if they contain sound doctrine, should be prohibited; the same may be said of popular sermons in the vulgar tongue. But if in any kingdom or province any books have been prohibited, because they contained some things which it would not be expedient should be read by all without selection, if their authors are Catholic, after they have been emended, they may be permitted by the bishop and the inquisitor. Rule VII Books which professedly treat of, relate, or teach lascivious or wanton subjects, since regard must be had not only of faith, but of morals also, which are wont readily to be corrupted by the reading of such books, are absolutely prohibited, and those who may possess them are to be severely punished by the bishops. But the ancient books written by the heathens, are permitted by reason of the elegance and propriety of their language; on no account, however, are they to be used by boys in their lessons. Rule VIII Books, whose prominent subject is good, in which, however, some things are incidentally inserted, which have a tendency to heresy or impiety, divination or superstition, may be allowed, when expurgated by Catholic theologians, by the authority of a general inquisition. Let the same judgment be formed touching prologues, summaries, or annotations, which have been annexed by condemned authors to books not condemned. But let them afterwards not be printed unless emended. Rule IX All books and writings in geomancy, hydromancy, aeromancy, pyromancy, oneiromancy, chiromancy, necromancy, or those in which drawing lots, sorceries, auguries, auspices, incantations of the magic art are contained, are altogether rejected. But let the bishops carefully see, that books, treatises, indices of judicial astrology be not read or kept, which dare to affirm something certain as likely to happen regarding future contingent successes, or fortuitous casualties, or those actions which depend on the human will. But judgments and natural observations are allowed, which are written for the purpose of aiding navigation, agriculture, or the medical art. Rule X In the printing of books or other writings, let that which was enacted in the Council of Lateran under Leo X., Session 10, be observed. Wherefore, if in the noble city of Rome any book is to be printed, let it be first examined by the vicar of the supreme pontiff, and the master of the sacred palace, or by persons to be deputed by our most holy lord. But in other places, let the approbation and examination of it appertain to the bishop or another person acquainted with the book or writing to be printed, such person to be deputed by the same bishop, and an inquisitor of heretical depravity of that state or diocese in which the printing will take place, and under the penalties and censures contained in the same decree, let it be approved by their hand, to be imposed by their own subscription, gratuitously, and without delay, this law and condition being added, that an authentic copy of the book to be printed, and one subscribed by the author’s hand, should remain with the examiner; but those who publish manuscript treatises, unless they are first examined and approved, the deputed fathers have judged ought to be subjected to the same penalties as the printers; and those who may keep and read them, unless they give up the authors, are to be considered as the authors. But let the approbation itself be given in writing, and let it appear authentically in front of the book, whether written or printed, and let the proving and examination of the book, and all the rest be done gratuitously. Moreover, in each state and diocese, let the houses or places where the art of printing is practised, and the libraries of books for sale be frequently visited by persons to be deputed for the purpose by the bishop or his vicar, and also by the inquisitor of heretical depravity, so that none of those things which are prohibited, may be printed, or sold, or kept. But let all librarians and booksellers soever keep in their libraries a catalogue of the books for sale, which they possess, with the subscription of the aforesaid persons, and let them have or sell no other books, or by any means deliver them without the license of the same persons to be deputed, under pain of the loss of the books, and other penalties to be imposed at the discretion of the bishops or inquisitors. And let the buyers, readers, or printers of the same, be punished at the pleasure of the same. But if any persons shall introduce any books soever into any state, let them be bound to report them to the same persons to be deputed, or, if a public place has been appointed for such wares, let the public servants of such place intimate to the aforesaid persons that such books have been brought. But let no one dare to deliver a book which he himself or another has brought into a city, to any person to read, or in any way to transfer or lend it, unless he has first shown the book, and has had a license from the persons to be deputed, or, unless it be notoriously ascertained that the book is now permitted to all. Let the same thing, also, be observed by the heirs and executors of last wills, so that they offer books which have been left by deceased persons, or a list of them, to the persons to be deputed, and let them obtain license from them, before they use them or in any way transfer them to other persons. But in all and each of these particulars, let the penalty be determined either of the loss of the books, or any other, according to the discretion of the same bishops or inquisitors, according to the nature of the contumacy or offence. But regarding the books which the deputed fathers have examined or expurgated, or have delivered to be expurgated, or have allowed, on certain conditions, to be again printed; whatever appears to have been enacted by them, let booksellers, as well as others, observe. Let it, however, be optional with bishops or general inquisitors, according to the powers which they possess, to prohibit even those books which seem to be permitted by these rules, if they should judge this to be expedient in their kingdoms, or provinces, or dioceses. But the names as well of the books which have been expurgated by the fathers deputed, as of those to whom they assigned this province, have, by order of our most holy lord, been delivered, copied out by the secretary of the same deputed persons to the notary of the sacred universal Roman inquisition. Finally, it is enjoined on all the faithful, that no one dare, contrary to the direction of these rules, or to the prohibition of this index, to read or keep any books. But if any one shall read or keep books of heretics, or the writings of any author condemned and prohibited for heresy, or for the suspicion of a false dogma, let him forthwith incur the sentence of excommunication. But, whoever shall read or keep books interdicted on any other pretext besides the guilt of deadly sin, with which he is affected, let him be severely punished at the discretion of the bishops. The Bull of Our Holy Lord Pius IV., by Divine Providence Pope APPROBATION OF THE INDEX OF PROHIBITED BOOKS, WITH THE RULES CONFIRMED BY THE FATHERS DEPUTED BY THE HOLY COUNCIL OF TRENT, AND THE PROHIBITION TO KEEP OR READ THESE BOOKS Pius IV., pope, for the future memory hereof. Appointed over the protecting the Lord’s flock by the disposition of the Lord, like unto a wakeful shepherd, we cease not to guard the flock itself with the utmost care and diligence from imminent dangers, lest through our negligence the sheep may perish, which were redeemed by the most precious blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. But although those matters which appertain to lay open the truth of faith and to confute the heresies of modern times were so enucleated and defined in the œcumenical and general Council of Trent, by the influence of the grace of the Holy Ghost, that it is now easy for each person to distinguish sound and Catholic doctrine from that which is false and spurious; yet, whereas the reading of books published by heretics is wont not only to corrupt mere simple men, but also to lead learned and erudite men into various errors and opinions, foreign to the truth of the Catholic faith, for this matter, also, we deemed it necessary to provide. But, knowing that the fittest remedy for that evil was, if an index or catalogue of the books which are either heretical, or suspected of heretical depravity, or at least, are injurious to morals and piety, were drawn up and published, we referred that matter to the sacred Synod of Trent: this [synod], out of so great a number of bishops and other most learned men, chose for drawing up that index many prelates distinguished as well for learning as judgment, from nearly all nations. They, indeed, perfected that index by God’s help, not without the greatest labour and much watching; certain most distinguished theologians also being called in to the council. But, the council being over, when, in pursuance of the decree of the synod itself, that index had been presented to us, so that it should not be published before it had been approved by us, we delivered it to certain most learned and approved prelates, to be read over most carefully, and to be examined, and we ourselves read it. When, therefore, we had ascertained that it had been drawn up with great study, keen judgment, and long care, and besides, most conveniently digested; we, desiring to consult for the salvation of souls, and for that reason to take care that no books and writings of any kind, which are disapproved in it either as heretical, or as suspected of heretical depravity, or as detrimental to piety and purity of morals, or at least, as requiring any correction, should hereafter be read by the faithful in Christ, by our apostolic authority do approve by these presents the index itself, together with the rules prefixed to it, and we command and decree that it be printed and published, and that it be received everywhere by all Catholic universities and all others soever, and that these rules be observed; prohibiting all and every one, as well ecclesiastical persons, secular and regular, of what grade, order, or dignity soever they may be, as lay persons endowed with any honour and dignity soever, that no one should dare to read or keep any books contrary to the prescriptions of these rules, and the prohibition of the index itself. But if any one shall act in opposition to these rules and Prohibition, he, indeed, who shall read or keep the books of heretics, or the writings of any author condemned and prohibited on account of heresy or the suspicion of false dogma, shall, by the very fact, fall under the penalty of excommunication, and for that reason it may be lawful to inquire into, and proceed against him as one suspected of heresy, besides the other penalties appointed for this by the Apostolic See and the sacred canons. But let him who shall read or keep books prohibited for any other cause besides the guilt of deadly sin, know that he is to be severely punished at the discretion of the bishops; notwithstanding any constitutions and ordinances soever to the contrary; or if an indult has been granted to any collectively or separately by the same see, so that they may not be excommunicated by apostolic letters, not making full and express and word for word mention of such indult. But that these things may come to the knowledge of all men, and that no one may be able to make use of the plea of ignorance, we will and command, that these letters be read out openly and with a loud voice by some ushers of our court in the Vatican Basilica of the prince of the apostles, and in the Lateran church, at the time when the people is wont to be assembled therein, in order to be present at the solemn sacrifice of the masses, and after they have been read out, they be affixed to the doors of these churches, and also of those of the apostolic chancery, and in the usual place of the Campo di Fiore, and let them be left there for some time, that they may be read and become known to all. But when they shall be removed thence, let copies of them remain affixed in the same places. But by this reading, publication, and affixing, we will that each and every person included in these letters, in three months, to be reckoned from the day of its publication and affixion, be [thereby] bound and obliged in the same manner as if they bad been published and read out to themselves. To copies also of it, which copies have been written, subscribed by the hand of some public notary, and vouched for by the seal and subscription of some person constituted in ecclesiastical dignity, we command and decree that credit be attached without any doubt. Given at Rome, at St. Peter’s, under the seal of the Fisherman, on the 24th day of March, 1564, the fifth year of our pontificate. Antonius Florabellus Lavellinus. The Constitutions TAKEN FROM THE ANCIENT LAW, AND NOTICED BY THE COUNCIL OF TRENT OR SPECIALLY CHANGED BY IT Council of Carthage: From the first part of the Decretum, Dist. XLI. cap. 7 (Sess. xxv. de ref. cap. 1.) Let the bishop keep plain furniture and [a plain] table, and poor diet, and let him seek the authority of his dignity by faith and by merits of life. Let him also have a hospitium not far from the church. Council of Chalcedon: From the first part of the Decretum, Dist. LXX. cap. 1 (Sess. xxiii. de ref. cap. 16.) That no one be absolutely ordained priest, or deacon, or any one constituted in ecclesiastical ordination, unless he who is ordained deserve the appellation of published ordination in the church of his city or estate, or in a martyrium, or in a monastery. But those who are absolutely ordained, the holy synod has decreed to have the imposition of hands unavailing, and that no suck act tends to the injury of him who has ordained him. Alexander III. in the Council of Lateran: From Book 1 of Decretals, tit. VI. on Election and the Power of the Elect, cap. 7 (Sess. vii. de ref. cap. 1.) Whereas in all sacred orders and ecclesiastical ministeries, maturity of age, gravity of morals, and knowledge of literature are to be inquired into, with much stronger reason ought these things to be inquired into in case of a bishop, who, placed in charge of others, ought to show in himself, after what manner it may be fitting that others should demean themselves in the house of God. On this account, lest what has been done regarding certain persons to meet the necessity of the time may be drawn by posterity into a precedent, we enact by the present decree, that no one be elected to the rank of a bishop who has not already passed the thirtieth year of life, and has been born from lawful wedlock; and, also, can be proved to be commendable in integrity of life and in knowledge. Alexander III: Ibid. § Inferiora (Sess. xxiv. de reform. cap. 12.) The inferior ministries, for instance the deanship, archdeaconship, and others which have the cure of souls annexed, let no one soever undertake, neither the government of a parochial church, unless he has already reached the twenty-fifth year of his age, and is to be recommended for knowledge and morals. But when he has been admitted, if an archdeacon, to a deacon, and the dean and others having been admonished, have not been ordained priests at the time prescribed by the canons, let them both be removed from that office, and let it be conferred on others, who may be both willing and able to fill it suitably. And let not the refuge of appeal avail them, if, perchance, to the transgression of that constitution, they should feel disposed to defend themselves by appeal. We enjoin this to be observed, if the canons do not oppose it, not only in the case of persons to be promoted, but also regarding those who have been already promoted. Alexander III. in the Council of Lateran: From Book III. of the Decretals, tit. IV. of Non-resident Clergy, cap. 3 (Sess. vii. de ref. cap. 3.) Because some, setting no limits to their avarice, endeavour to obtain different ecclesiastical dignities, and several parish churches contrary to the institutes of the sacred canons, so that, whilst they scarcely suffice to discharge one office, they claim to themselves the emoluments of very many; we strictly forbid that that be done for the future, when, therefore, a church or an ecclesiastical office has to be disposed of, let such a person be sought for as will be able to reside on the spot, and to take the charge of it on himself. But if the matter should be otherwise, both let him who has received what he has accepted in violation of the sacred canons lose it, and let him who has conferred it, be deprived of the power of giving. Alexander III: From Book III. Decret., tit. XLVIII. on the Building or Repairing of Churches (Sess. xxi. de reform. cap. 4.) Know that it has reached our ears that the demesne which is called H, is represented as being so far distant from the parish church, that, in the winter season, when the rains fall heavily, the parishioners cannot approach it without great difficulty; in consequence, they are not able to be present at their ecclesiastical duties at the proper time. Because, therefore, the aforesaid church is said to abound so greatly in revenues, that, besides the proceeds of that demesne, the minister of it is well able to have support, we command, that if matters are so, you build there a church, and place a priest therein, the obstacle of appeal being taken away, at the presentation of the rector of the greater church, with the canonical assent of the founder, which priest is to receive the ecclesiastical proceeds of the same demesne for his own support; taking care, however, that due honour in it be reserved for the mother church, according to the ability of the place, which, indeed, seems to be possible, when the proprietor of the same demesne is willing to contribute twenty acres of good land for the uses of the priest. But if the parson of the mother church delay to present a proper individual, or shall be disposed to impede that measure, do you, nevertheless, see that the same measure be brought to perfection, and omit not to induct a worthy man, the refuge of appeal being taken away. Boniface VIII: From the Sixth of the Decretals, lib. 1, tit. III. on Rescripts, cap. 11 (Sess. xxv. de reform. cap. 10.) A statute, which we recently published concerning judges to be deputed by the Apostolic See, we have deemed it necessary to reform for the better by the present sanction, which we command to be observed without infringement, being urged to from regard to utility, because some things contained in it, which were supposed to have been introduced for the common interest (as experience showed), were discovered to possess a mischievous tendency. We therefore enact, that to none but those endowed with dignity, or holding a personate, or to canons of cathedral churches, causes touching the authority of letters of the Apostolic See, or its legates, be in future intrusted; and that they be heard nowhere else than in cities or remarkable places where access to skilful persons may readily be had. Boniface VIII: From the Sixth of the Decretals, lib. 3, tit. II. concerning Married Clerks, cap. 1 (Sess. xxiii. de ref. cap. 6.) Clerks, who have contracted with single persons and virgins, if they lay aside the tonsure and clerical garments, may retain the privilege of the canon issued by our predecessor, Innocent II., in favour of the entire clerical order. [L. c. 29, c.xvii. q. 4.] And whereas, according to the Council of Paris [c. 2, x. de foro comp. ii. 2], no clerk can be constrained or condemned by a secular judge, by our present edict we declare, that such clergy, being married, cannot, for excesses or offences committed by them, be forced, by a criminal or civil indictment, before the secular seat of judgment, nor ought they to be, by any means, condemned by secular judges themselves, either in person or even in money (that there may not in one way be conceded to the same judges what is denied by another). But in all other cases, or unless, as it is premised, they lay aside the tonsure or clerical garments, even in the premised cases we are unwilling that they should enjoy the clerical privilege. Boniface VIII: From the Sixth of the Decretals, lib. 3, tit. III. of Clergy not residing in the Church or Prebend, cap. 1 (Sess. xxiv. de ref. cap. 12.) Entirely disapproving the custom, which has come in vogue in certain parts, according to which canons and other beneficed persons, or clergy of cathedral and other collegiate churches, enjoy daily distributions (which are otherwise named manual benefices, or victuals, and are bestowed only on residents), after what manner soever they may be present in the cities or other places in which the churches themselves stand, though they may not attend at the divine offices, precisely as if they officiated regularly in the same offices in the very churches, we decree, that these daily distributions, of what things soever they consist, be bestowed on the canons and other beneficed persons and clergy of the very churches, who may attend at the same offices in the churches themselves, according to the proportioned ordination of any church already made or even to be made. But whoever shall receive anything out of these distributions otherwise (excepting those who might be excused by infirmity, or a just and reasonable bodily necessity, or the evident interest of the Church), he is not to acquire the ownership of the things so received, nor is he to make them his own; nay, he is to be bound to a restitution of all that he has received contrary to this our constitution. Concerning the distributions also to be given away for the anniversaries of the dead, we decree that the same thing is to be observed. Boniface VIII: From the Sixth of the Decretals, lib. 3, tit. XVI. on the State of the Regulars, cap. 1 (Sess. xxv. de regul. et monial. cap. 5.) Desiring to make wholesome provision for the dangerous and detestable state of certain nuns (who, the reins of decency being released, and monastic modesty and respect for sex being shamefully cast aside, wander about, sometimes through the habitations of secular persons outside their own monasteries, and frequently admit suspicious persons within the same monasteries, to the grievous offence of Him to whom they have devoted their purity of their own free will, the opprobrium of religion, and the scandal of very many), by the present constitution, which is for ever to continue valid, we ordain, that all and every nun, present and future, of what profession and order soever they may be, in whatever parts of the world existing, ought for the future to remain under perpetual enclosure in their monasteries, so that no one of them who has professed religion tacitly or expressly is to have or can have, on any account or any pretext soever (unless it should perchance be evident that some of them evidently laboured under such a disease, that she could not reside with others without great danger or scandal), permission to leave their monasteries for the future, and that no person in any respect indecent, or even decent (unless there arise a reasonable and manifest cause, and according to the special license of him who may be concerned), is to have no ingress nor access to the same, so that, thus separated from all mundane and public sights, they may be more at liberty altogether to serve God, and, all opportunity of lasciviousness being taken away, they may be able more carefully to guard their hearts for the same and their bodies in all sanctity. And, indeed, that this salutary statute may more conveniently be observed, we strictly inhibit any females from being admitted for the future among the sisters in the monasteries of the non-mendicant orders, unless as many as can be supported without penury out of the goods or revenues of the monasteries themselves; decreeing whatever may be done otherwise to be null and void. But when the abbess or prioress of any monastery shall have to do homage for the feud by which she holds the monastery from some prince or temporal lord, or to take an oath of fealty to him (unless that she may be able to do this through the proctor), she may in that case have liberty to leave her monastery with a seemly and becoming society, sure to return forthwith after the homage is done, or the oath of fealty has been taken, so that nothing soever may be done to the detriment of residence or of monasterial seclusion. Furthermore, that nuns may have no cause or opportunity for straying about, we beg, require, and beseech, by the bowels of the mercy of Jesus Christ, of all secular princes and other temporal lords, still recommending the same persons (so to do) for the remission of sins, that they would suffer the abbesses and prioresses themselves, and all nuns soever, bearing charge of their monasteries, as also the administration and affairs of the same, under what names soever they may be styled, to conduct their litigations through the medium of proctors in their tribunals or courts, so that it may not be necessary that they should stray about instead of appointing proctors (who in some places are called attorneys), or other such persons. But if any shall presume [to act] otherwise, refusing to comply with such reasonable and holy exhortation, as it is contrary to justice that women (especially religious women) should conduct lawsuits personally, and as it is swerving from the path of decorum, and involves the danger of souls, they should be forced to this (line of conduct) by ecclesiastical censure, through their own ecclesiastical ordinaries. But on the bishops and other prelates, superior and inferior, whoever they be, we enjoin, that they themselves shall see that the causes and transactions, which the aforesaid nuns shall have to manage, be carried on and managed in their own presence, or in the courts of the same, whether they be homages, oaths of fealty, lawsuits, or other matters, through the agency of their proctors. And since it be not enough to establish laws, unless there were persons who would take charge of their being duly put in execution, we strictly command all patriarchs, primates, archbishops, and bishops collectively, in virtue of holy obedience, under the invocation of divine judgment, and the threat of eternal malediction, that any of them, with respect to the monasteries of nuns subjected to them by ordinary right, in their state and in their own diocese, [should be mindful] by their own authority, but, in regard to those which belong immediately to the Roman Church, by authority of the Apostolic See; but that abbots and other excepted prelates of churches, monasteries, and orders whatsoever, should be mindful, in such monasteries subjected to them, to take measures as soon as they conveniently can, regarding a proper closing, where such does not exist, at the expense of the monasteries themselves, and through the alms of the faithful, which they should take care to be carefully made for this purpose, and shutting in the nuns themselves, if they would avoid the acrimony of the Divine anger and ours, by checking contradictory and rebellious persons by ecclesiastical censure, appeal being laid aside, calling in, if need shall be, the aid of the secular arm. But through this let not the ordinaries of the several places believe that any jurisdiction or power in other respects is by any means granted to them. Clement V. in the Council of Vienna: Ex Clementinis, lib. 1, tit. VI. touching the Age, and Quality, and Order, of those to be set over, cap. 2 (Sess. xxii. de reform. cap. 4.) That those who are bound or shall hereafter be bound to divine offices in cathedral or collegiate, secular or regular churches, may the more readily be induced to take on them holy orders, we determine that no one in future shall have a voice in the chapter in such churches (although this may be freely conceded to them by others), unless he has been placed in the order of subdeaconship. But let those who now peacefully hold in the same churches, or shall in future hold dignities, personates, offices, or prebends, to which certain orders have been annexed, unless (a just impediment being wanting) they shall cause themselves to be promoted to such orders within a year from thence, until they have been advanced to them, by no means have a voice in the chapter of the same; and let the half of the distributions given to those who attend at certain hours, be deducted from them, any customs or statutes notwithstanding; the other penalties, which are of right enacted against those refusing to be promoted to orders, being nevertheless to continue in their proper force. Clement V. in the Council of Vienna: Ex Clementinis, lib. 3, tit. I. on the Life and Becoming Demeanour of Clerks (Sess. xiv. de reform. cap. 6.) Since he who, laying aside the garments suited to his order, presumes to take others, and to wear them in public without any reasonable cause, renders himself unworthy of the privilege of the professors of that order, we decree, by the present constitution, that whatever clerk shall wear a striped or party-coloured dress (unless a reasonable cause exists), if he happen to be beneficed, shall be suspended from the enjoyment of the emoluments of the benefices which he holds; but if he be not beneficed, yet being placed in holy orders within the priesthood, he is rendered for the same length of time incapable of holding an ecclesiastical benefice. The same regulation we enact regarding other clergy, publicly laying aside the vestis talaris and the clerical tonsure. But a person holding a dignity, personate, or any other benefice upon which the cure of souls is incumbent, as likewise all others constituted in the priesthood, and any religious persons soever, whom it behoveth to display internal goodness by the decency of their external garb, if (except from a reasonable cause) they shall publicly wear a garment of this kind, or publicly carry on their head an infula or pileus lineus, they by the very fact, being beneficed, to wit, are to be suspended for a year from the enjoyment of the fruits of the benefices which they hold. But all other priests and all religious persons soever are to be rendered for the same time incapable of holding any ecclesiastical benefice soever. But let both such and all other clerks soever using the epitogium or tabardus fœderatus usque ad oram, and so short, that it evidently seems to be an inferior garment, let the secular clergy, and the religious holding administration, be bound within a month to give it to the poor; but let the other religious holding administration be bound within that same space of time to assign it over to their superiors, to be converted to some pious uses. Otherwise let beneficed persons know that they have incurred the aforesaid penalties of suspension, but the others the penalties of incapability [to hold a benefice] during the same period of time. To this ordinance we yet further add, that clerks, especially beneficed, must not use in public caligæ scacatœ, ruby or green. Clement V. in the Council of Vienna: Ex Clementinis, lib. 3, tit. XI. concerning Religious Houses, cap. 2 (Sess. vii. de reform. cap. 15, et Sess. xxv. de reform. cap. 8.) Because it sometimes happens that the rectors of xenodochia, of leprosy-houses, alms-houses, or hospitals, laying aside all care of the places, neglect to wrest the goods, chattels, and their rights from the hands of occupiers and usurpers, nay, more, allow them to tumble down and be destroyed, the houses and buildings to be disfigured with ruins, and not heeding the fact that the places were founded and endowed for this purpose, that paupers and leprous persons might be admitted within them, and be supported from the revenues thereof, they inhumanly refuse to do so, converting the same revenues to their own uses, to their own damnation, when, however, these things which were intended for a certain use by the liberality of the faithful, ought to be applied to that use, and not to any other (saving, however, the authority of the Apostolic See), we, detesting such negligence and abuse, ordain, with the approbation of this sacred council, that those to whom that duty appertains by right or statute, framed at the time of founding the places, or by custom legitimately prescribed, or by privilege of the Apostolic See, should make it their study to introduce wholesome reforms into these same places in all the aforesaid particulars, and cause those that have been unduly seized on, lost, and sequestered, to be brought back to the due state, and that they should not omit to force the aforesaid rectors to admit these miserable persons, and to allow them due support, according to the means and revenues of the places themselves. In which, if they perchance evince any negligence or deficiency, we enjoin the ordinaries of the places, that although the aforesaid pious places may possess the privilege of exemption, they are to fulfil all and each of the preceding particulars, and that they compel those same rectors, not privileged by their own, but those exempted and other privileged persons by the apostolic authority; restraining all refractory persons, of what state or condition soever they may be, or those who abet the same rectors by their counsel, aid, or favour touching the matters premised, by means of ecclesiastical censure and other remedies of the law; yet thereby occasioning no prejudice to the exemptions or privileges themselves as to other matters. But in order that what has been premised may more properly be observed, let none of these places be conferred on secular clergy as a benefice, although this may have been observed by custom (which we condemn entirely), unless at their foundation it may have been constituted otherwise, or provision regarding a rector may have to be made for such places by election. But let the government of these be intrusted to provident, competent men of good testimony, who may know how, be willing and able to direct the places themselves, their goods and rights, and faithfully to dispense their proceeds and revenues to the use of miserable persons, and men who are not likely to apply the aforesaid goods to other uses; in which we burden the consciences of those to whom the commission of the aforesaid places appertains, under the invocation of the divine judgment. Let those also, to whom the government or administration of the aforesaid places shall be committed, be bound to make oath after the manner of guardians and curators, and to draw up inventories regarding the goods of the places themselves, and render an account of their administration every year to the ordinaries or others, who have such places under them, or to those to be deputed by them. But if any one shall attempt to act otherwise, we decree that the collation, provision, or the ordination itself is destitute of all validity. But we by no means wish that the matters premised should extend to the hospitals of military orders, or of other religious persons. The rectors of which hospitals we command, in virtue of holy obedience, that they take care to provide for the poor therein, according to the institutes of their orders and the ancient observances, and to afford in them the due meed of hospital attendance, to which they should be constrained by severe strictness, any statutes or usages soever notwithstanding. But it is part of our intention, that if any hospitals, having an altar or altars, or cemetery, from a remote period, and officiating priests, and persons ministering the ecclesiastical sacraments to the poor, or if the parochial rectors should have been wont to officiate in them, the ancient custom premised may be preserved with respect to exercising and administering the aforesaid spiritual matters. Eugenius IV: From lib. 5, Extravagantium communium, tit. VII. de privilegiis, cap. 3 (This is abrogated in Sess. xxiii. de reform. cap. 1, and Sess. xxiv. de reform. cap. 11.) Placed by the will of the divine clemency on the conspicuous watch-tower of the Apostolic See, we readily direct our attention to those things, through which the officials of the aforesaid see may, in obedience to it (to which, as the mother of all the faithful, the multitude flock from different parts of the world, to seek the salvation of souls and to attain justice), be more securely and peaceably enabled to show themselves alert. Hence it is that we, moved by certain reasonable causes, treading in the footsteps of some of our predecessors, more strictly prohibit the ordinaries of places, as also their commissioners and delegates, and all others, each and every one, by what power and authority soever they may be distinguished, of what dignity, grade, or pre-eminence soever they may be, from presuming to proceed against the aforesaid officials, by what title soever they may be named, being in obedience to us and to the aforesaid see now and for the time, and also against any other persons soever coming to the aforesaid see for the prosecution of the causes and transactions on one side or the other, and delaying in it (during the prosecution of such transactions and causes), or from promulging against them sentence of excommunication, suspension, or interdict, or of privation of offices or benefices, or any other sentence soever. For we declare all and every process and sentence passed and entertained contrary to the tenor and meaning of this our prohibition, and [all] to be hereafter entertained and promulged, and whatever may thence follow, as null, void, and unavailing, and to have been, or to be, of no validity or moment. In like manner, whatever may have been attempted wittingly or ignorantly contrary to this by any person, of what authority soever, either hitherto, or may happen to be attempted hereafter, we likewise decree that it be null and void, and nevertheless against all and each of the ordinaries and officials, commissaries and their delegates, who, by interfering with any dignities and ecclesiastical benefices soever of the aforesaid officials, either prosecuting such transactions before the Holy See, by depriving them of them, and decreeing or declaring them to be private persons, or by conferring them on other persons under any private pretext, or by interfering with them in any way soever, we promulge as well against the givers as the receivers, sentence of excommunication, suspension, and interdict, which [sentence] we will that they incur by the very fact; from which sentence of excommunication they shall be unable to be absolved, unless by us, or persons to be deputed by us, unless they be at the very point of death. But we will, by our own certain knowledge, that the above be binding, and operate on all persons soever from the day in which these presents are affixed to the doors of the Basilic of the prince of the apostles, in the city. All apostolical and general, or provincial or synodal councils soever, edicts, constitutions, ordinances, and apostolic privileges, by which the effect of these presents might in any way be impeded or delayed, even though special mention might have to be made of them and of their entire tenor in these presents, and which by these presents we wish to hold as sufficiently expressed, and all other things soever to the contrary notwithstanding. To no one then, etc. Given at Rome, at St. Peter’s, in the year of the incarnation of our Lord 1432, on the 8th of the Ides of March, the second of our pontificate. Gregory X. at the Council of Lyons: From the Sixth of the Decretals, lib. 1, tit. VI. on Election and the Power of the Elected, cap. 14 (Sees. vii. de reform. cap. 3.) Though a canon, put forth by our predecessor, Pope Alexander III., of happy memory, has decreed among other matters, that no person is to undertake the government of a parochial church, unless he has reached the twenty-fifth year of his age, and is worthy of being recommended by his knowledge and morals, and that such person, when elected to this government, if, having been admonished, he is not ordained to the priesthood at the time fixed by the canons, is to be removed from the duty of such government, and that it be conferred on some other person; because, however, in the observance of the above-mentioned canon, many show themselves negligent: we, wishing that their dangerous negligence be made up for by the execution of the law, ordain by our present decree, that no one be admitted to the government of a parochial church, unless he be qualified by morals, knowledge, and age; decreeing that collations to be made of parochial churches to those who have not reached their twenty-fifth year shall hereafter be utterly invalid. He, also, who shall be appointed to such government, that he may take better care of the flock intrusted to him, is bound personally to reside in the parochial church of which he may be rector, and cause himself to be promoted to the priesthood within a year, to be reckoned from the time of the government having been committed to him. But if he shall not have been promoted within the said time, let him, by the authority of the present constitution, be deprived of the church intrusted to him, without any previous admonition. But touching the residence as above mentioned, the ordinary may grant a dispensation according as a reasonable cause requires it. Gregory X. in the Council of Lyons: From the Sixth of the Decretals, lib. 1, tit. XVI. on the Office of the Ordinary, cap. 3 (Sess. vii. de reform. cap. 5.) Let the ordinaries of places strictly compel their subjects holding several dignities or churches, to whom is intrusted the cure of souls, or a personate, or dignity with another benefice, to which a similar cure is annexed, to exhibit the dispensations, by the authority of which they claim canonically to hold churches, personates, or dignities, within a time to be settled by the will of the ordinaries themselves, according to the nature of the proceeding. But if it perchance happen that, just impediment being wanting, no dispensation is exhibited within the same time, let the benefices of the church, personates, or dignities, which it is evident are held illicitly without a dispensation, be freely conferred on proper persons, through those to whom the collation thereof appertains. But if the dispensation exhibited appear to be sufficient, let the person exhibiting it not be molested in such benefices as he holds canonically. Let the ordinary, however, take care that the cure of souls be not neglected in the same churches, personates, or dignities, and that the benefices themselves be not defrauded of their due rights. But if doubt be entertained concerning the sufficiency of the dispensation exhibited, regarding this, recourse is to be had to the Apostolic See, whose province it is to estimate what he would wish to be the limit of its own grant. Yet further, in conferring personates, and dignities, and other benefices having the cure of souls annexed, let the same ordinaries observe this diligence, that they do not presume to confer a personate, dignity, or other benefice having a similar cure of souls, on any person holding several of the same kind, until a dispensation evidently sufficient be shown by them regarding those so obtained, which being shown, we desire that they at length proceed to the collation, if it appear by the same that the person on whom the collation is to be made can freely retain such personate, dignity, or benefice, along with those already held, or if he freely and willingly resign those which he thus holds. Otherwise, let a collation made of personates, dignities, and such benefices, be of no moment soever. Gregory X. in the Council of Lyons: From the Sixth of the Decretals, lib. 3, tit. XX. on Estimates or Exactions made under a Plea of Procuration, cap. 2 (Sess. xxiv. de reform. cap. 2.) The audacity of the perverse requires that we be not content with the mere prohibition of misdemeanours, but also, that we impose a penalty on those offending. Willing, therefore, that the constitution of Pope Innocent IV., of happy memory, our predecessor, published regarding the non-acceptance of procurations in money, or on the receiving of gifts interdicted to visitants and their associates, which the temerity of many is said to transgress, should be inviolably preserved, we decree that it be strengthened by the addition of a penalty; enacting, that all and every individual who shall presume to exact money on account of a procuration due to him on the score of a visitation, or even to receive it from a willing person, or in any other way to violate the constitution itself by receiving presents, or, the office of visitation not being rendered, [by receiving] a procuration in victuals, or anything else under the plea of a procuration, let such persons be bound to refund, within a month, double of that which they may have received, to the church from which it may have been received. Otherwise, let patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, delaying to restore this double sum within the prescribed time, know that henceforward their entrance into the church is interdicted. But let inferior functionaries know that they are suspended from their office and benefice, no remission, largess, or favour of the givers being to avail them in this particular. Innocent III. in the Council of Lateran: From Book 1 of the Decretals, tit XXXI. on the Office of the Judge, cap. 15 (Sess. v. de reform. cap. 2.) Among other matters which tend to the salvation of the Christian people, the food of the word of God is known to be especially necessary to them; because, as the body is nourished by material, so is the soul by spiritual food, because not in bread alone doth man live, but in every word which proceeds from the mouth of God. Whence, whereas it frequently happens that bishops, on account of their manifold engagements, or corporeal infirmities, or the incursions of enemies, or other causes (not to mention deficiency of knowledge, which in them is to be reprobated, and no longer to be tolerated for the future), are not of themselves sufficient to minister to the people the word of God, more especially throughout their extensive and scattered dioceses; by a general constitution, we enact, that the bishops appoint competent men to perform in a wholesome way the office of holy preaching, men powerful in work and in speech, who, instead of themselves, seeing they are unable, anxiously visiting the people committed to them, may edify them by word and example, to whom, when they are in want, let them minister the necessaries, lest for lack of necessaries they be obliged to desist from their undertaking. Whence, we enjoin that proper persons be ordained as well in cathedral as in other conventual churches, whom the bishops may be able to have as coadjutors and assistants, not only in the office of preaching, but also in hearing confessions, and enjoining penance, and in other matters relating to the salvation of souls. But if any one neglect to fulfil this, let him be subjected to strict retribution. Innocent III. in the Council of Lateran: From Book 3 of the Decretals, tit. V. on Prebends and Dignities, cap. 28 (Sess. vii. de reform. cap. 4.) It was with much foresight prohibited at the Council of Lateran, that no one should receive different ecclesiastical dignities, or several parochial churches, contrary to the institutes of the sacred canons; otherwise the receiver should lose one so received, and the person conferring it should be deprived of the power of bestowing it. But because, by reason of the presumption and greediness of certain persons, none or rare advantage has hitherto resulted from the aforesaid statute, we, desirous to meet [the evil] more evidently and more expressly, determine by our present decree, that whoever shall receive any benefice having the cure of souls annexed, if he previously held such a benefice, shall be by the very fact deprived thereof, and if perchance he should strive to retain it, he be also deprived of the other. He, also, to whom the granting of the former belongs, may freely confer that, after the reception of the other, upon the person to whom it may seem to be conferred deservedly, and if he shall delay to confer it beyond six months, the collation is not only to devolve upon others, according to the statute of the Council of Lateran, but also, he is to be obliged to make over as much out of his own proceeds for the good of the church to which the benefice belongs, as it is evident has been derived since the time of its becoming vacant. The same regulation we decree to be observed with respect to personates, adding, that no one is to presume to hold in the same church a plurality of dignities or personates. In the case, however, of exalted and learned persons, who are to be honoured with greater benefices, a dispensation may be granted by the Apostolic See, when reason shall require it. Innocent III: Ibid. cap. 29 (Sess. vii. de reform. cap. 3.) It is too grievous and too absurd, that some prelates of churches, when they are able to promote qualified persons to ecclesiastical benefices, scruple not to select unworthy persons, who have not the suffrage either of correctness of morals, nor of the possession of learning, following the affections of the flesh, not the judgment of reason; from which source, no one of sound mind can be ignorant what heavy destruction results to the churches. Wishing, therefore, to remedy this disease, we enjoin that, passing by the unworthy, they select the deserving, who may be willing and able to bestow on God and the churches a grateful service, and that a careful examination be made annually touching this matter in the provincial council, in such a manner that he who, after the first and second correction, has been found blame-worthy, may be suspended from conferring benefices by the council itself, a provident and reputable person being appointed in the same council, who may supply the defect of the suspended person in conferring benefices. And let this same be observed with respect to the chapters which may have transgressed in these particulars. But let the delinquency of the metropolitan be left to the judgment of the superior, to be reported on the part of the council. But that this wholesome provision may obtain fuller effect, let the sentence of such suspension, besides the authority of the Roman pontiff, or of the proper patriarch, be by no means relaxed, that in this, also, the four patriarchal sees may be especially honoured. Innocent III. in the Council of Lateran: From Book 3 of the Decretals, tit. XXXV. on the State of Monks, cap. 7 (Sess. xxv. de regul. et monial. cap. 8.) In every kingdom and province, let there be every three years, without detriment to the right of the diocesan pontiffs, a common chapter of the abbots, and of the priors not having their own abbots, who have been accustomed to attend such chapters, at which all not labouring under a canonical impediment are to assemble at one of the monasteries suited for this purpose; this check being applied, that none of them is to bring more than six evictions and eight persons. But at the commencement of this innovation, let them cite in charity two abbots of the Cistercian order, who may be near at hand, to afford advice and timely aid, as by long custom they are more fully informed in holding such chapters; who are to associate without contradiction with themselves from among themselves, two persons whom they shall consider to be expedient. And let these four preside over the entire chapter, so that from this none of them is to assume the authority of precedence, whence, should it seem expedient, they may be changed after careful deliberation. But let such chapter be held on some certain days successively, according to the custom of the Cistercian order, in which a careful consideration may be entertained touching the reformation of the order and regular observance; and let whatever may have been ordained with the approbation of these four persons, be inviolably observed by all, all excuse, contradiction, and appeal being removed, a provision nevertheless being made as to where the chapter is to be held in the following term. And let those who may assemble lead a life in common, and let them contribute proportionally to all the common expenses in such a manner, that, if all cannot dwell in the same houses, at least the greater number may tarry together in different houses. Let there be ordained in the same chapter religious and circumspect persons, who may in our stead be careful to visit each abbey of the same kingdom or province, not only of the monks but of the nuns also, according to the prescribed form, correcting and reforming whatever they may observe to stand in need of the office of correction and reform, so that, should they know that the rector of a place ought to be removed entirely, signify to his own bishop that he should take care to remove him; which should he not do, the visitors themselves must refer it to the inquiry of the Apostolic See. This same [ordinance] we desire and recommend that the regular canons observe according to their own order. But if in this innovation aught of difficulty should arise, which cannot be got over by the aforesaid persons, reference may be made without scandal to the judgment of the Apostolic See, all the other points being without infraction observed, which may have been provided for by united deliberation. Furthermore, let the diocesan bishops so study to reform the monasteries subjected to them, that when the aforesaid visitors may come to them, they may find more in them which may be deserving of commendation than of correction; most attentively taking care that the monasteries already mentioned be not oppressed by them with undue burdens, because we desire that the rights of the superiors be observed, so that we should not wish to allow of the wrongs to the inferiors. To this end, we strictly enjoin, as well to diocesan bishops as to the persons who shall preside over the holding of the chapters, that appeal being removed by ecclesiastical censure, they would restrain advocates, patrons, vice-lords, rectors and consuls, nobles and soldiers, or any other persons soever, that they presume not to offend the monasteries in persons and things. And if perchance they should offend, they should not neglect to force them to make satisfaction, to the end that they may be able the more freely and quietly to do services unto Almighty God. Innocent III. in the Council of Lateran: From Book 4 of the Decretals, tit. III. on Clandestine Betrothal, cap. 3 (Sess. xxiv. decret. de reform. matr. cap. 1.) Whereas the prohibition of the conjugal tie has been recalled in the three last degrees, we desire it to be strictly observed in other cases. Whence, treading in the footsteps of our predecessors, we altogether prohibit clandestine marriages; forbidding even any priest from being present at such. Wherefore, extending the special usage of some places to others generally, we decree, that when marriages are to be contracted, they be called out publicly by the priests in the churches, a sufficient period being defined, that within it whosoever may be willing and able may oppose a legitimate impediment, and the presbyters themselves may nevertheless examine whether any impediment stand in the way. But when a probable conjecture shall appear against the tie to be contracted, let the person so contracted be expressly interdicted, until it shall appear from plain proofs what ought to be done on the subject. Innocent III. in the Council of Lateran: From Book 5 of Decretals, tit. I. on Accusations and Inquisitions and Denunciations, cap. 24 (Sess. xxiv. de reform. cap. 5.) After what manner and how a prelate ought to proceed to inquire into and to punish the excesses of his subjects, is evidently inferred from the authorities of the New and Old Testament, from which subsequently proceeded the canonical enactments, as on a former occasion we distinctly noted, and now confirm by the approbation of the sacred council. For it is read in the Gospel, that the steward who had got into bad repute with his master, as though he had wasted his goods, heard from him: What is this I hear of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest no longer be steward. And in Genesis, the Lord says: I will go down and see, whether they have filled up the cry which indeed hath reached me. From which authorities it is clearly proved that not only when the subject, but even when the prelate transgresses, if it reach the ears of the superior by clamour and report, not indeed by the evil-intentioned and evil speakers, but by provident and reputable persons, and not once only, but frequently (which is intimated by clamour and evinced by general report), he ought, in presence of the seniors of the church, carefully to investigate the truth, to the end that, if the nature of the thing should require it, canonical severity may punish the offence of the delinquent, not as though he were the author and informer, but as though he were performing the duty of his office from the reports of fame or the denunciation of clamour. But although this is to be observed in the case of subjects, a more careful observation is to be made in the case of prelates, who are set up as it were as a mark for the arrow. And because they cannot please all, inasmuch as by their office they are obliged not only to reprove, but also to rebuke, nay, sometimes also to suspend, on some occasions even to bind, they frequently incur the ill-will and hatred of many, and become exposed to treachery; it is for this reason the holy fathers with foresight ordained, that an impeachment against prelates be not readily listened to, lest, the pillars being shaken, the edifice should totter, unless diligent caution be applied, by means of which the door may be shut against not only false, but also against malignant crimination. But in such manner did they wish to provide for the interests of prelates, that they might not be accused unjustly, so, however, as to beware that they did not offend insolently, finding a suitable remedy against both diseases, to the end that a criminal accusation, which is brought in order to procure degradation, may by no means be admitted, unless a legitimate inscription precede. But when any one has become so infamous by reason of his excesses, that the cry now ascends, which can no longer be concealed without scandal, or tolerated without danger, without a scruple of doubt, a desire to inquire into and punish his excesses should proceed, not from any lurking hate, but from a feeling of charity, inasmuch as, if the excess be serious, though he may not be degraded from his order, he may, however, be removed from the administration, which is according to the sentence in the Scripture, for the steward to be removed from his stewardship, who cannot render a proper account of his stewardship. Wherefore, he ought to be present against whom the inquiry is to be made, unless he shall absent himself through contumacy, and those heads are to be explained to him, concerning which inquiry shall have to be made, that he may have an opportunity of defending himself. And not only the sayings, but the names also of the witnesses are to be published for him, that it may appear what may have been said and by whom; and, also, lawful exceptions and replies are to be admitted, lest by a suppression of names there may be occasioned a daring spirit of defaming, and by an exclusion of exceptions, a spirit of alleging falsehood. To correct, therefore, the excesses of his subjects, the prelate ought to arise so much the more diligently, as he would incur greater damnation in allowing their offences to pass by uncorrected; against whom, to say nothing of our excesses, though there are three modes of proceeding, viz., by their accusation, denunciation, and inquisition, so however that diligent caution be applied in all cases, lest by taking an easy short cut a heavy loss be sustained, as an inscription ought legitimately to precede an accusation, so also ought a charitable admonition to precede a denunciation, and a clamorous insinuation an inquisition, such check being always employed, that according to the form of the trial, the form of the sentence also be worded. This order, however, we do not think ought always and in every particular to be observed regarding regular persons, who, when occasion requires, can be removed from their administration more readily and more freely. Innocent III: From Book 5 of the Decretals, tit. XXXIII. on Privileges and Excesses of Privilege, cap. 16 (Sess. xxiv. de reform. cap. 11.) Whereas the chapel of the duke of Burgundy is said to enjoy this privilege, that no archbishop or bishop dare to publish sentences either of suspension, or excommunication, or interdict against the persons of the canons of that chapel, some canons of the aforesaid chapel who hold parochial churches from you, by occasion of the aforesaid privilege in those also whose jurisdiction appertains to you, say that they are exempt, so that however seriously they may sometimes transgress, they may refuse to submit to your correction and sentence, Wherefore, we command that in so far as they are exempt, with respect to the same chapel you may submit reverently to the apostolic privileges, but in so far as they are known to refer to your jurisdiction with respect to parochial churches or otherwise, you may freely follow up with regard to the same that which is due to your office. Innocent III. in the Council of Lateran: From Book 5 of the Decretals, tit. XXXVIII. on Penances and Remissions, cap. 12 (Sess. xiii. de sacr. euch. can. 9, et Sess. xiv. de sacr. pœnit. can. 8.) Every one of the faithful of either sex, when such person has reached the years of discretion, should alone confess all his or her sins faithfully, at least once a year to his own priest, and endeavour to fulfil according to his ability the penance enjoined on him, receiving reverently, at least at Easter, the sacrament of the Eucharist, unless perchance he may think it right to abstain for a time from receiving it, for some reasonable cause, according to the advice of his own priest; otherwise, whilst living, let such person be debarred from entering the church, and when dead, let him be deprived of Christian burial. Whence, let this salutary statute be published frequently in the churches, that no one may in the blindness of ignorance take on a veil of excuse. But if any one shall wish to confess his sins to a strange priest for a just cause, let him first demand and obtain leave from his own priest, since, otherwise, the other can neither loose nor bind him. Innocent IV. in the Council of Lyons: From the Sixth of the Decretals, lib. 2, tit. XV. de appellat. cap. 3 (Sess. xxii. de reform. cap. 7.) “Romana ecclesia et infra.” Whereas the consistory or auditory of the suffragans of the church of Rheims and of their officials (who generally examine into the causes appertaining to their court in their stead), is to be accounted as one and the same, an appeal is to be made from the officials themselves not to the aforesaid suffragans (lest the appeal might seem to be made from the same to themselves), but by right to the court of Rheims. But the appeal ought to be made from the archdeacons and other inferior suffragan prelates subject to the same, and from their officials to the suffragans themselves, and not to the same court (omitting the aforesaid suffragans), unless custom warrants the church of Rheims in doing something else in this particular. But when an appeal has been made from the audience of the same suffragans or their officials to the above-mentioned court, let the archbishop of Rheims for the time being, or his official, on no account cite the parties, in the case of an appeal being lodged, before the definitive sentence, and let them not commit it to others, without expressing a probable or lawful cause of the same appeal. But if, the parties being cited, it be set forth either that the appeal had not been made at all, or not within ten days after the interlocutory or final sentence, or something else of the kind, and thus that the matter did not devolve by appeal upon the same archbishop or his official: let the same (unless it first be evident to them that the cause itself was laid wholly before them) not presume to prevent them from proceeding in that cause, or [from going on] to the execution of the sentence. But if it be objected that the appeal laid arose from an unjust cause, or from one not altogether legitimate before the sentence, and in consequence thereof that no such appeal is to be admitted; the aforesaid archbishop or his official cannot prevent them from proceeding in the cause, unless the appeal being first received, as arising from a probable cause, they begin to learn regarding such a cause whether it be true. But if it be said that the appeal was made after sentence in cases not interfered with by law (as after sentence pronounced on a manifest and notorious crime, or one to which the party has confessed), or in such like, they may prevent the sentence being carried into execution (after they have begun to take cognizance whether the appeal interposed by him is to be received or not). Against another also, who makes any attempt after their inhibition regarding the matter in dispute between the appellant and his adversary, they cannot claim any jurisdiction to themselves on an occasion of this kind. But when he who sends forth the voice of appeal on any cause to the court of Rheims, he must, nevertheless, submit in other causes to the jurisdiction of his ordinary; let not the archbishop of Rheims or his official interfere with his jurisdiction in other cases, so as entirely to take such appellant from the power of the same ordinary. But the appeal ought to be made to them from the bishops of the aforesaid province relative to causes in which they exercise temporal jurisdiction, unless perchance it may be necessary to appeal to another, by custom or privilege, or some other special right. Sentences also of interdict, or of suspension, or excommunication, promulged against an appellant by him from whom it is proposed to appeal, are by no means to be revoked and declared null and void, unless the parties be summoned, and the appeal be duly taken cognizance of. But when an appeal has been made before sentence to the archbishop of Rheims from the audience of his suffragan on any cause, let the same archbishop (after he has examined the cause, and ascertained that it is not a reasonable one) not delay to send back the cause to the same suffragan. Innocent IV. in the Council of Lyons: From the Sixth of the Decretals, lib. 5, tit. VII. de Privilegiis, cap. 1 (Sess. vii. de reform. cap. 14.) Wishing that the liberty, which the Apostolic See has conceded to some with a privilege of exemption, should be observed so unimpaired, that both others may not infringe it, and they themselves may not exceed its limits, we define by an irrefragable declaration, that however much those so exempted may enjoy such liberty, still, however, with respect to the offence, whether of contract, or of the matter concerning which proceedings are taken against them, they may duly be convened before the ordinaries of the places, and they may with respect to this exercise their jurisdiction against them (as justice requires). Are they then altogether deprived of the advantage of liberty in these instances? Certainly not; because neither in presence of the ordinaries themselves, provided it was in the exempted place that the fault was committed, or the contract entered into, or the matter, the subject of litigation, took place, nor where they hold a residence, if they commit the offence elsewhere, or make the contract, or the matter itself occur, can they be convened in any respect regarding these points; nor under the pretext of residence are the diocesans of places (if they be convened where they have committed the offence, or have entered into a contract, or the matter itself takes place) to have any power to send them back there, or to enjoin them to answer there; reserving, nevertheless, other cases, in which the canonical institutes direct them to be subject to the jurisdiction of the bishops. And this same decree we pass concerning those to whom it has been conceded by apostolic privilege, that they are not obliged to answer those bringing complaints against them except before one judge. But against those, to whom indulgence has been conceded by the Apostolic See, that they cannot be interdicted, suspended, or excommunicated by any one, as several of them are religious persons, in whose privilege it is contained, that no bishop or archbishop can presume to interdict, suspend, or excommunicate the monks of their monasteries for any cause, or in any place: the same ordinaries cannot at all exercise their jurisdiction with regard to those matters, wheresoever they may be, unless perchance the monks themselves have been appointed to the priorships of their monasteries, subject to the same ordinaries. For then, though they may freely be recalled to the same monasteries, and be considered as monks of those as well as of the priorships themselves (as it is not inconsistent that any one should hold a monastic place in both), it is known that one is subject to another monastery, or is dependent on it; with respect, however, to the same priorships, the aforesaid ordinaries can lawfully avail themselves of their jurisdiction in these even, as far as the preceding (as long as they tarry in them). Leo X. in the Council of Lateran: Sess. X. regarding the Printing of Books (Sess. iv. decret. de edit. et usu sacr. libror. et reg. x. de libris prohibitis, suprà.) Lest that which has been wholesomely invented unto the glory of God, and the increase of the faith, and the propagation of the liberal arts, be converted to the contrary effect, and bring forth detriment to the salvation of the faithful of Christ, we deemed it right that our solicitude should be exercised concerning the printing of books, lest in future thorns grow up along with the good seed, or poisons be mixed up with medicines. Wishing, therefore, to provide an opportune remedy for these, with the approbation of this sacred council, that the business of the printing of such books may succeed with the greater prosperity, in proportion as a more close search shall be employed with greater diligence and caution: we decree and ordain that henceforward in the time to come, no one shall presume to print, or to cause to be printed, any book, or any writing soever, as well in our city as in all other cities and dioceses soever, unless such books or writings be first carefully examined in the city by our vicar and the master of the sacred palace, but in other states and dioceses by the bishop, or some other person possessing an acquaintance with science, to be deputed for that purpose by the same bishop, and by the inquisitor of heretical depravity, in the state or diocese in which the printing of such books might take place, and be approved by their subscription with their own hand, to be affixed gratuitously and without delay, under the sentence of excommunication. But whosoever shall presume to act otherwise, beside the loss of the books so printed, and their being publicly burnt, and the payment of one hundred ducats to the manufactory of the prince of the apostles in the city, without hope of its being remitted, and the suspension for an entire year of the practice of printing, let him be entangled in sentence of excommunication, and finally, his contumacy becoming worse, let him be so chastised by his bishop or our vicar respectively through all the remedies of the law, that others may not presume after his example to attempt the like. To no one, therefore, etc. But if any one, etc. Given at Rome, in the public Basilica, solemnly celebrated on the year of the incarnation of our Lord 1515, fourth of May, in the third year of our pontificate. Sixtus IV: Ex lib. 3, Extravagantium communium, tit. XII. touching the Relics and the Veneration of Saints, cap. 1 (Sess. v. decret. de pecc. orig.) When we investigate with the scrutiny of devout consideration the exalted insignia of the merits with which the queen of the heavens, the glorious virgin mother of God, advanced to the ethereal dwellings, shining amid the constellations as the morning star, and revolve beneath the secrets of our breast, that she herself, as the path of mercy, the mother of grace, and the friend of piety, the consoler of the human race, the sedulous and vigilant advocate on behalf of the salvation of the faithful, who are oppressed by the load of their offences, intercedes with the King whom she has brought forth; we consider it meet, nay, rather due, to invite by indulgences and the remissions of sins, that they may thereby become more fitted for divine grace, by the merits and intercession of the same Virgin, all the faithful in Christ to return thanks and praises for the wonderful conception of the immaculate Virgin to Almighty God (where Providence regarding from eternity the humility of the same Virgin, for the reconciling to its author human nature, which, by the fall of the first man, became subject unto eternal death, by the preparation of the Holy Ghost, constituted her as the habitation of his only begotten, from whom he should take on him the flesh of our mortality for the redemption of his people, and she should remain, nevertheless, an immaculate virgin after the birth), and offer up masses and other divine offices instituted for that purpose in the church of God, and be present at them. Induced, therefore, by this consideration, confiding in the authority of the same Almighty God, and in that of his blessed apostles Peter and Paul, by the apostolic authority, which is to be in force for ever, by this constitution, we decree and ordain, that all and every one of the faithful of Christ, of both sexes, who shall devoutly celebrate and offer up on the day of the festival of the Conception of the same Virgin Mary, and during its octave, the mass and office of the Conception of the same glorious Virgin, according to the pious, devout, and praise-worthy ordinance of our beloved son Leonardi de Nogarole, clerk of Verona, our notary, and the institution of such mass and office which emanated down from us, or shall be present thereat in the canonical hours; as often as they shall do so, they are to obtain the same precise indulgence and remission of sins, which, according to the constitutions of Urban IV., of happy memory, approved at the Council of Vienna, and of Martin V., and of other Roman pontiffs, our predecessors, those are entitled to, celebrate and offer up the mass in canonical hours at the festival of the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ from the first evening and during its octave, according to the constitution of the Roman Church, or who are present at the mass, at the office, and at such hours; these presents to be in force for all time. Given at Rome, at Saint Peter’s, in the year of the incarnation of our Lord 1476, third of the calends of March, in the sixth year of our pontificate. Sixtus IV: Ibid. cap. 2 (Sess. v. Decret. de peccato originali.) We bear a burden too onerous and painful, when unfavourable reports are brought to us regarding certain ecclesiastical persons. But in the excesses committed in preaching by those who are deputed to announce the word of God, we are the more provoked at it, in proportion as they remain with greater danger uncorrected, when the errors, which are impressed on the hearts of many by thus preaching publicly in a more diffused and damnable manner, cannot easily be done away with. And truly, when the holy Roman Church solemnly publicly celebrates a festival concerning the conception of the undefiled and (ever-Virgin Mary), and has ordained regarding this a special and peculiar office, some preachers of different orders, as we have heard, in their discourses to the people publicly have hitherto not blushed to affirm, through different states and lands, and cease not daily to preach, that all those who hold or assert, that the same glorious and immaculate mother of God was conceived without the stain of original sin, commit deadly sin, or that they are heretics; that those celebrating the office of the same immaculate conception, and hearing the discourses of those who affirm that she was conceived without such stain, sin grievously. But not content with the aforesaid preachings, they have published books got up about these their assertions, from whose assertions and preachings no inconsiderable scandals have arisen in the minds of the faithful, and still greater are dreaded to arise every day. We then, desiring to obviate such rash daring and perverse and scandalous assertions, which may thence arise in the Church of God, as far as is permitted us from on high, of our own proper motion, not at the instance of any petition presented to us on the point, but from our own mere deliberation and certain knowledge, reprobate and condemn by apostolic authority, by the tenor of these presents, such assertions of the same preachers, and of any other persons soever, who presume to affirm that those who believe or hold that the same mother of God was at her conception preserved from the stain of original sin, are for this reason polluted with the stain of any heresy, or committed mortal sin; or that when celebrating such office of the conception, or listening to such discourses, that they incur the guilt of any sin, as being false and erroneous, and utterly foreign from the truth; and, moreover, in this respect, the aforesaid published books containing such assertion, and by the aforesaid motion, knowledge, and authority, we determine and ordain, that the preachers of the word of God, and any other persons soever, of what state, grade, order, or condition soever they may be, who in future shall presume, by rash daring, to affirm to the people, or in any other way soever, that such assertions, so disapproved and condemned by us, are true, or to read as true the aforesaid books, to hold or to keep them, after they have obtained the knowledge of these presents, incur by the very fact sentence of excommunication, from which they cannot obtain the benefit of absolution from any other person save from the Roman Pontiff, except at the very point of death. Likewise, by a similar motion, knowledge, and authority, subjecting to the same penalty and censure those who shall presume to assert, holding a contrary opinion, viz. that the glorious Virgin Mary was conceived with original sin, incur the guilt of heresy, or deadly sin, when it was not yet decided by the Roman Church and the Apostolic See; any apostolic constitutions and ordinances soever to the contrary notwithstanding, to which, whether in common or separately, there may exist an indult from the Apostolic See, that they cannot be interdicted, suspended, or excommunicated by apostolic letters, not making full, express, and word for word mention of such indult. And lest at any time they may be able to allege ignorance with regard to the foregoing, we desire that the requisite ordinaries of the places would deliver, in their discourses to the people, and cause to be published the present letters in the churches situate in their states, and in remarkable places of their dioceses, when a considerable multitude of the people has assembled for divine service. Moreover, because it would be difficult to convey the present letters to the individual places, wherein it might be expedient, we also will and decree, by the aforesaid authority, that a copy of the same letter, drawn up by the hand of a notary-public, and confirmed with the authentic seal of some ecclesiastical prelate, be observed everywhere, as the same original letter would be observed, if it were exhibited or shown. Be it lawful, therefore, for no person soever to infringe this page of our reprobation, condemnation, statute, ordinance, will, and decree, or by rash attempt to contravene it. But if any one shall presume to attempt it, let him know that he will incur the indignation of Almighty God, and of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul. Given at Rome, at Saint Peter’s, in the year of the incarnation of our Lord 1483, the day before the nones of September, in the thirteenth year of our pontificate. APPENDIX of certain other documents which seem to be useful to candidates in theology I. Condemnation of the errors of Wickliff, Hus, and Luther The sacred and holy Synod of Constance, holding a general council, and representing the Catholic Church, &c. For the perpetual memory thereof. The Catholic Faith, &c. The following are the articles of John Wickliff. 1. The substance of the material bread, and in like manner the substance of the material wine, remain in the sacrament of the altar. 2. The accidents of bread do not remain without a subject in the same sacrament. 3. Christ is not in the same sacrament, identically and really in his own corporal presence. 4. If a bishop or priest be in mortal sin, he does not ordain, he does not consecrate, he does not effectually celebrate [the Lord’s Supper], he does not baptize. 5. It is not founded in the gospel that Christ ordained the mass, 6. God ought to obey the devil. 7. If man were duly contrite, all exterior confession is superfluous and useless. 8. If the Pope is a reprobate and evil, and consequently a member of the devil, he has not power given him by any one over the faithful, unless perhaps by Cæsar. 9. After Urban VI. no man is to be admitted as Pope, but we must live after the manner of the Greeks under our own laws. 10. It is contrary to holy Scripture, that ecclesiastical persons should have possessions. 11. No prelate ought to excommunicate any person, unless he first knows that he has been excommunicated by God; and let him who so excommunicates be thereby a heretic, and excommunicated. 12. A prelate excommunicating a clerk, who has appealed to the king or the council of the kingdom, is by that very fact a traitor to the king and kingdom. 13. They who discontinue to preach or hear the word of God on account of the excommunication of men, are excommunicated, and in the judgment of God will be deemed traitors to Christ. 14. It is lawful for any deacon or priest to preach the word of God without the authority of the Apostolic See or Catholic bishop. 15. There is no civil master, no prelate, no bishop, whilst one is in mortal sin. 16. Temporal masters can take away at pleasure temporal goods from the Church, those in possession habitually offending, i. e. offending from habit, not from act merely. 17. Subjects can, according to their pleasure, correct their masters when offending. 18. Tithes are pure alms, and parishioners can take them away at pleasure, on account of the sins of their prelates. 19. Special prayers applied to one person by prelates or religious persons are not more profitable to the same than general prayers, cæteris paribus. 20. He who confers alms on brethren is excommunicated by that very fact. 21. If any one enter any private religious order soever, as well of persons possessing property as of mendicants, he is rendered the more unfit and inapt for observing the commands of God. 22. The saints founding private religions sinned in so founding. 23. Religious persons living in private religions are not of the Christian religion. 24. Brethren are bound to acquire a livelihood by the labour of the hands, and not by mendicancy. 25. All are simonists who bind themselves to pray for others who relieve them in temporals. 26. The prayer of a reprobate avails no one. 27. All things happen from absolute necessity. 28. The confirmation of the young, the ordination of the clergy, the consecration of places, are reserved for the Pope and bishops, through the desire of temporal lucre and honour. 29. Universities, studies, colleges, graduations, masteries in the same, are introduced by vain gentility; they only profit the Church as the devil does. 30. The excommunication of the Pope, or of any prelate soever, is not to be dreaded, because it is the censure of antichrist. 31. Those founding cloisters sin, and those entering are diabolical men. 32. To enrich the clergy is contrary to the rule of Christ. 33. Pope Silvester and the Emperor Constantine erred in endowing the Church. 34. All of the order of mendicants are heretics, and those giving them alms are excommunicated. 35. Those entering religion, or any order, are by the very fact unfit to observe the divine precepts, and consequently to reach the kingdom of heaven, unless they shall have apostatized from the same. 36. The Pope with all his clergy holding possessions are heretics in this, that they hold possessions, as also are those consenting to them, all secular princes forsooth, and the rest of the laity. 37. The Roman Church is the synagogue of Satan; nor is the Pope the next and immediate vicar of Christ and of the apostles. 38. The decretals of the Church are apocryphal, and seduce from the faith of Christ; and the clergy are fools who study them. 39. The emperor and secular princes were seduced by the devil to endow the Church with temporal goods. 40. The election of the Pope by the cardinals was introduced by the devil. 41. It is not necessary to salvation to believe that the Roman Church is supreme amongst other churches. 42. It is silly to put confidence in the indulgences of the Pope and of bishops. 43. Oaths are unlawful which are intended to strengthen human contracts and civil intercourse. 44. Augustin, Benedict, and Bernard, were damned if they did not repent of their having had possessions, and of having instituted and entered religions; and thus, from the Pope to the last religious, all are heretics. 45. All religions were introduced indifferently by the devil. End of the Articles of Wickliff. And the same John Wickliff composed books, named a Dialogue and Trialogue, by himself, and several other tracts, volumes, and minor works, in which he inserted, and dogmatically set down, certain proscribed articles, and several other damnable ones, &c. These again having been brought to the knowledge of the Apostolic See, and of the general council, the Roman Pontiff (Johannes XXIII. in obedience to it), in the last Roman Council held, condemned the aforesaid books, tracts, and minor works. But this sacred synod caused the forty-five articles aforesaid to be examined, and frequently to be reviewed by several most reverend fathers of the Roman Church, cardinals, bishops, abbots, masters in theology, doctors of both laws, and several deserving of notice in a numerous multitude; which articles having been examined, it was discovered, as it is in truth, that some and several of them had been and were notoriously heretical, and long since reprobated by the holy fathers; that others were not catholic, but erroneous; others scandalous and blasphemous; some offensive to pious ears; some of them rash and seditious. It has even been ascertained, that his book contains several other articles of similar qualities, and that they introduced in the Church of God a doctrine that was frantic, and inimical to faith and morals. On this account, this sacred synod, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, ratifying and approving the sentences of the above-mentioned archbishops and of the Roman Council, by this perpetual decree reprobates and condemns the aforesaid articles, and each and every one of them, the books of the same, named by the same John Wickliff Dialogue and Trialogue, and other books of the same author, volumes, tracts, and minor works, by what name soever they may pass, which it here wishes to be held as being sufficiently expressed. But, because the aforesaid books having been carefully examined by the doctors and masters of the University of Oxford, beyond the forty-five articles above mentioned, they have collected two hundred and sixty articles exclusive of them, some of which coincide in sentiment with the above-mentioned, though not in the same form of words, and as has been above said of others, some of them were and are heretical, some seditious, some erroneous, some rash, some scandalous, others insane, and also almost all contrary to good morals and Catholic truth, were for that reason reprobated scholastically and duly by the aforesaid university. This sacred synod accordingly, with the deliberation above mentioned, reprobates and condemns the aforesaid articles, and each and every one of them, prohibiting, commanding, enjoining, and decreeing, as regarding the forty-five others. The tenor of the same two hundred and sixty articles we considered should be inserted below. The series, however, of these articles does not appear in the collection of the councils. The sacred and holy General Synod of Constance, representing the Catholic Church, lawfully assembled in the Holy Spirit, for the perpetual memory thereof. Quia teste veritate, etc. Wherefore plenary information having been first had regarding the preceding matters, and by a careful deliberation of the most reverend Lords Fathers in Christ, or Cardinals of the Roman Church, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, and other prelates, and doctors of the sacred page, and of both laws, in a numerous crowd, this sacred Synod of Constance declares and defines, that the articles below written,—which, a collation being made by several masters in the sacred page, were found to be contained in his books and works written with his own hand, and which also the same John Hus, in a public audience before the fathers and prelates of this sacred council, confessed to be contained in his books and works,—are not catholic, nor to be set down as such, but that several of them are erroneous, others scandalous, some offensive to pious ears, and several of them rash and seditious, and some of the same to be notoriously heretical, and long since reprobated and condemned by the holy fathers and general councils … But whereas the articles written beneath are expressly contained in his books or tracts, viz., in the book which he entitles “on the Church,” and in other works of his, for this reason the above-mentioned books, and doctrine, and each of the other tracts and works published by him in the Latin or common Bohemian dialects, this sacred synod reprobates and condemns, decides and defines that they be burned publicly and solemnly in the presence of the clergy and people in the state of Constance and elsewhere … peremptorily commands, that diligent inquiry be made through the ordinary of the place, after such tracts and works with ecclesiastical censure, also, if it shall be necessary, with the addition of a penalty, and of a leaning to heresy, and that when found they be burned publicly in the flames. Considering the measures adopted in the case of heresy against the aforesaid John Hus … the sacred and holy synod pronounces, decrees, and declares, that the aforesaid John Hus had been and is a real and manifested heretic … Condemned articles of John Hus, of which mention is made above 1. There is one holy Universal Church, which is the whole body of the predestined. 2. Paul never was a member of the devil, though he may have done some acts similar to the acts of the malignants of the Church. 3. The prescite are not parts of the Church, since no part of it will finally fall off from it, because the charity of predestination, which binds it, will not fall off. 4. Two natures, divinity and humanity, are one Christ. 5. The prescitus, though he is sometimes in grace according to present justice, yet is never part of the Church, and the predestined always remains a member of the Church, although he may sometimes fall away from adventitious grace, but not from the grace of predestination. 6. Taking the Church for the convocation of the predestined, whether they be in grace or not according to present righteousness, in that way the Church is an article of faith. 7. Peter is not nor was he head of the holy Catholic Church. 8. Priests living criminally in any way soever pollute the power of the priesthood, and so as unfaithful sons think unfaithfully of the seven sacraments of the Church, of the keys, offices, censures, morals, ceremonies, and sacred things of the Church, veneration of relics, indulgences, and orders. 9. The papal dignity derived its strength from Cæsar, and the full establishment and institution of the Pope emanated from the power of Cæsar. 10. No one without a revelation could assert reasonably of himself, or of another, that he was head of a particular church. 11. It would not be fitting to believe that he, whoever is Roman pontiff, is the head of any particular holy church soever, unless God predestined him. 12. No one acts as vicar to Christ or Peter, unless he follows him in morals, since no other appendage is more pertinent, nor can he otherwise receive from God the vice-gerent power, because for that office a vicarship and conformity of morals is required, and the authority of an instituent. 13. The Pope is not the true and manifest successor of Peter, prince of the apostles … if he lives with morals contrary to Peter, and if he seek avarice, he is then vicar of Judas Scariot. And with equal evidence the cardinals are not the true and manifest successors of the college of the other apostles of Christ, unless they have lived after the manner of the apostles, keeping the commandments and counsels of our Lord Jesus Christ. 14. Doctors laying down that any one to be corrected by ecclesiastical censure, if he be unwilling to be set aright, is to be delivered over to secular judgment, certainly follow in this the priests and scribes and Pharisees, who, when saying it is not lawful for us to put any one to death, delivered over Christ himself, when not wishing to obey them in all things, to the secular power, and that they are real homicides, more grievous than Pilate. 15. Ecclesiastical obedience is obedience according to the invention of priests of the Church, exclusive of the express written authority. 16. The immediate division of human works is, that they are either virtuous or vicious: because if man is vicious and does anything, he then acts viciously; and if he is virtuous, and does anything, he then acts virtuously; because as vice, which is called crime, or deadly sin, infects universally the acts of a vicious man, so virtue enliveneth all the acts of a virtuous man. 17. Priests of Christ living according to his law, and possessing an acquaintance with the Scripture and a desire to edify the people, ought to preach, notwithstanding a pretended excommunication. But if the Pope or any other prelate commands a priest so disposed not to preach, he ought not submissively to obey. 18. Any one receives the office of a preacher by mandate, who attains the priesthood, and that mandate he ought to execute, notwithstanding the pretended excommunication. 19. By ecclesiastical censures of excommunication, suspension, and interdict, the clergy get under their feet the lay people for their own exaltation, multiply avarice, protect wickedness, and prepare the way for antichrist. It is an evident sign that such censures proceed from antichrist, which in their processes they call fulminations, by which the clergy chiefly proceed against those who lay bare the wickedness of antichrist, who will use the clergy chiefly for himself. 20. If the Pope is evil, and especially if he is a reprobate, then as Judas he is an apostle of the devil, a thief, and the son of perdition, and is not the head of the holy Church militant, since he is not even a member of it. 21. The grace of predestination is a bond by which the body of the Church, and every member of it, is indissolubly joined to Christ the head. 22. Pope or prelate, evil and a reprobate, is equivocally pastor, and truly thief and robber. 23. The Pope ought not to be called most holy, even according to his office, because otherwise the king would have a right also to be called most holy as to his office, and torturers and criers should be called holy, nay the devil even would have a right to be called holy, as being an officer of God. 24. If the Pope live in a manner contrary to Christ, although he should ascend through the right and lawful election according to the common human ordinance, yet he would ascend by another way than through Christ, granting even that he should enter by an election principally made by God: for Judas Scariot was elected rightfully and lawfully by the Lord Jesus Christ to the episcopacy, and yet he ascended by another way to the sheep-fold. 25. The condemnation of the 45 articles of J. Wickliff, by the doctors, was an unreasonable one, and unjust, and wickedly done, and the cause alleged by them was feigned; viz., from this circumstance, that none of them was catholic: but any one of them is either heretical, or erroneous, or scandalous. 26. Not for this very reason because the electors, or the majority of them, consent vivâ voce, according to the usages of men, to some person, such person is not for that very reason lawfully elected; not for that very reason the true and manifest successor, or vicar of the apostle Peter, or of another apostle, in ecclesiastical office: whence, whether the electors have elected him rightly or otherwise, we ought to trust to the works of the elect; for in proportion as any one works more abundantly in a manner meritorious unto the proficiency of the Church, in greater. abundance has he from God the means for this. 27. There is not a spark of appearance, that there should be one head governing the Church in spirituals, which may ever be conversant and preserved with the Church militant itself. 28. Christ without such monstrous heads would regulate the Church better by means of his true disciples scattered throughout the world. 29. The apostles and faithful priests of the Lord strenuously regulated the Church in things necessary unto salvation, before the office of pope was introduced; so would they do, even were a pope wanting to the day of judgment. 30. No one is a civil prince, no one is a prelate, no one a bishop, whilst he is in deadly sin. For the Bull of Martin V., dated at Constance, on the 8th of the calends of March, 1418, which contains the articles of Wickliff and Hus inserted, and condemns the same, with the approbation of the Sacred Council of Constance,—see vol. iii. Concil. Harduin. p. 905, et seq. The Bull of Leo X. against Luther, 18th of the calends of July, 1520, Leo episcopus, &c. Exsurge Domine, &c. But of these errors (of Luther) we thought that some ought to be inserted among the present, the tenor of which is here given, and is as follows: 1. It is an heretical, but common opinion, that the sacraments of the new law confer justifying grace on those who do not place a barrier. 2. To deny that sin remains in a child after baptism is to trample down Paul and Christ together. 3. The leaven of sin, though no actual sin may be present, delays the soul departing from the body from entering heaven. 4. The imperfect charity of a dying man carries with it great fear as necessary, which of itself alone is enough to cause the punishment of purgatory, and hinders the entrance of heaven. 5. That there are three parts of penance,—contrition, confession, and satisfaction,—is not founded in the Sacred Scripture, nor in the ancient holy Christian doctors. 6. Contrition, which is prepared by discussion, collation, and detestation of sins, by which any man considers his years in the bitterness of his soul, weighing the enormity of his sins, their multitude, foulness, the loss of eternal happiness, and the incurring of eternal damnation, this contrition makes a hypocrite, nay, rather a sinner. 7. The truest proverb, and one surpassing all the doctrine hitherto given regarding contrition, that hereafter the highest penance will not suffice, the best penance is a new life. 8. By no means presume to confess venial sins, nor even all deadly sins, because it is impossible that you should know all deadly sins: whence in the early church they only confessed manifest deadly sins. 9. Whilst we desire to confess all things purely, we do nothing else, than that we wish to leave nothing to the mercy of God to pardon. 10. Sins are not remitted to any one, unless he should believe them remitted: for the remission of sin and granting of grace suffices not, but it is necessary also to believe that it is remitted. 11. By no means trust that you are acquitted on account of your contrition, but for the word of Christ: Whatsoever thou shalt loose, &c. Here, I say, trust, if you have obtained the absolution of a priest, and believe firmly that you are acquitted, and you will be truly acquitted, however it may be with contrition. 12. If through an impossibility, he who has confessed were not contrite, or if the priest absolved not seriously but in jest, if, nevertheless, he believe that he is absolved, he is most truly absolved. 13. In the sacrament of penance, and in the remission of guilt, the Pope or bishop does not more than the lowest priest; nay, to you he is not a priest; just as much would any Christian be, even though it were a woman or a boy. 14. No one ought to answer to a priest, that he is contrite, nor should a priest require it. 15. Great is the error of those, who approach the sacrament of the Eucharist, depending on this, that they are not conscious to themselves of any deadly sin, that they premised their prayers and preparatory (duties); all those persons eat and drink judgment to themselves. But if they believe and hope that they shall there obtain grace, this faith alone makes them pure and worthy. 16. It seems a thing advised that the Church should determine in common council that the laity should communicate under both species; nor are the Bohemians when communicating under both species heretics, but schismatics. 17. The treasures of the Church, whence the Pope grants indulgences, are not the merits of Christ and of the saints. 18. Indulgences are the pious frauds on the faithful, and remissions of good works, and are of the number of those things which are lawful, and not of the number of those which are expedient. 19. Indulgences avail not those who truly obtain them for the remission of the punishment due to divine justice for actual sins. 20. Those are led astray who believe that indulgences are salutary, and useful for spiritual fruits. 21. Indulgences are necessary only for public crimes, but are properly granted to the obdurate only and to the impatient. 22. To six classes of men indulgences are neither necessary nor useful: viz. to the dead or to those about to die, to the infirm, to those lawfully hindered, to those who have not committed crimes; to those who have committed crimes, but not public ones; to those who do better works. 23. Excommunications are only external penalties, nor do they deprive a man of the common, spiritual prayers of the Church. 24. Christians are to be taught to love excommunication more than to fear it. 25. The Roman Pontiff, successor of Peter, is not vicar of Christ instituted over all churches of the entire world by Christ himself in Saint Peter. 26. The word of Christ to Peter: Whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, &c. extends only to things bound by Peter himself. 27. It is certain that it is not at all in the power of the Church or of the Pope to determine articles of faith, nay neither the laws of morals nor of good works. 28. If the Pope thought so or so with a great part of the Church, and even did not err, still it is not a sin or heresy to think the contrary, especially in a matter not necessary unto salvation, until the one has been reprobated, the other approved by a universal council. 29. The way has been opened for us of breaking down the authority of councils, and of freely contradicting their transactions, and of judging their decrees, and of confidently confessing whatever seems true, whether it be approved or reprobated, by any council soever. 30. Some articles of John Hus, condemned in the Council of Constance, are most Christian, true, and evangelical, which neither the universal Church could condemn. 31. In every good work the just man sins. 32. A good work done after the best manner is a venial sin. 33. That heretics should be burned is contrary to the will of the Spirit. 34. To contend against the Turks is to resist God, visiting our iniquities through them. 35. No one is certain that he is not always sinning mortally, by reason of the most secret vice of pride. 36. Free will after sin is a thing of a mere name, and whilst it does that which is in it, it sins mortally. 37. Purgatory cannot be proved from Holy Scripture, which is in the canon. 38. Souls in purgatory are not secure of their salvation, at least all, nor is it proved by any, either reason or Scripture, that they are without the state of meriting or increasing charity. 39. Souls in purgatory sin without intermission, so long as they seek rest, and have a dread of punishments. 40. Souls freed from purgatory by the suffrages of the living are less beatified than if they had given satisfaction by themselves. 41. Ecclesiastical prelates and secular princes would not do ill if they all did away with all the sacks of mendicancy. All and each of the aforesaid articles, or errors, as being, as is premised, respectively heretical or scandalous, or false, or offensive to pious ears, or suited to lead astray simple minds, or contrary to Catholic truth, we condemn, reprobate, and entirely reject, &c. II.—Condemnation of the Baian errors, etc. (Bull of S. Pius V. an. 1567.) Pius, bishop, servant of the servants, &c. Of all the afflictions which we, established in this place by the Lord, endure at so melancholy a time, this sorrow chiefly tortures our soul, that the Christian religion, long since agitated by so many whirlwinds, has to struggle daily with new opinions started, and the people of Christ, cut in pieces at the suggestion of the old enemy, is carried away indiscriminately and promiscuously into one error after the other. But as far as regards ourselves, we strive with all our might, that these, as soon as they bound forth, should be entirely put down; for we are affected with great sorrow, that most persons of otherwise tried probity and learning, burst forth into various sentiments full of offence and danger, both by word and by writing, and concerning them they dispute with each other, even in the schools, of which kind are the following: 1. Neither the merits of an angel or of the first man still undefiled are rightly called grace. 2. As a bad work is of its nature deserving of eternal death, so a good work is of its nature deserving of eternal life. 3. Both to good angels and to primitive man, if he had persevered in that state, even to the last period of life, happiness would be reward, and not grace. 4. Life eternal was promised to man yet pure, and to the angel, in regard of good works; and good works by the law of nature are sufficient of themselves to attain it. 5. In the promise made to the angel and to the first man are contained the natural constitution of justice, by which for good works, without any other respect, life eternal is promised to the just. 6. By the natural law it was ordained for man that, if he persevered in obedience, he should pass on to life eternal, in which he could not die. 7. The merits of the first man intact were the gifts of the first creation; but, according to the mode of speaking the Sacred Scriptures are not rightly called grace; whence it comes, that they ought only to be named merits, not grace. 8. In those redeemed by the grace of Christ, no good merit can be found, which is not conferred gratuitously on an unworthy object. 9. Gifts granted to man in a state of purity, and perhaps to an angel, may be called grace, for a reason not to be disapproved; but because, according to the use of Sacred Scripture, those gifts only are understood by the name of grace, which are conferred through Jesus Christ on those ill-deserving and unworthy; for this reason, neither merits, nor the reward which is rendered to them, ought to be called grace. 10. The payment of the temporal penalty, which often remains after the sin is remitted, and the resurrection of the body, is to be ascribed properly to the merits of Christalone. 11. That we attain eternal life, in this mortal life, being preserved piously and justly even to the end, is to be set down not properly to the grace of God, but also to the natural ordinance established at the commencement of creation, by the just judgment of God; nor in this retribution of the good is respect had to the merit of Christ, but only to the first institution of mankind, in which it has been established by the natural law, that by the just judgment of God, life eternal be rendered to obedience to his commands. 12. The opinion of Pelagius is, a good work done without the grace of adoption, is not deserving of the kingdom of heaven. 13. Good works done by the sons of adoption receive not the account of merit from this, that they are done by the spirit of adoption inhabiting the hearts of the sons of God; but only from this, that they are conformable to the law, and because by them obedience to the law is shown. 14. The good works of the just do not receive on the day of the last judgment a more ample reward, than they deserve to receive from the just judgment of God. 15. The notion of merit consists not in this, that he who does well has grace, and the Holy Spirit in-dwelling; but in this only, that he obeys the divine law. 16. That is not true obedience to the law, which is without charity. 17. Those think with Pelagius, who say, that it is necessary to the notion of merit, that man should be raised through the grace of adoption to a deific state. 18. The works of catechumens, as faith and penance done before the remission of sins, are deserving of eternal life, which life they shall not themselves attain, unless the impediments of preceding transgressions be first taken away. 19. The works of justice and of temperance, which Christ did, derived not greater value from the worthiness of the person operating. 20. There is no sin venial in its nature, but every sin merits eternal punishment. 21. The elevation and exaltation of human nature to a participation of the divine nature due to the integrity of the first state, and therefore is to be called natural, and not supernatural. 22. They think with Pelagius, who understand the apostle’s text to the Romans II. The gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things which are of the law, of those nations not having the grace of faith. 23. The opinion of those is absurd, who say, that by a certain supernatural and gratuitous gift, man has been exalted from the beginning above the condition of his nature, that by faith, and hope, and charity, he might worship God supernaturally. 24. By vain and idle men, according to the folly of philosophers, was devised the opinion, which is to be referred to Pelagianism, that man was so constituted from the beginning, that through the gifts superadded to nature he was exalted by the bounty of his Maker, and adopted as the son of God. 25. All the works of the unbelieving are sins, and the virtues of philosophers are vices. 26. The integrity of the first creation was not an exaltation undue to human nature, but its natural condition. 27. Free-will, without the aid of God’s grace, avails only to commit sin. 28. It is a Pelagian error to say that free-will availeth to avoid any sin. 29. Not only are those thieves and robbers who deny Christ to be the way and the door of the truth and of life, but those also whosoever teach that it is possible to ascend by any other means than through him, to the path of righteousness (that is, any righteousness). 30. Or [who teach] that man can resist any temptation without the aid of His grace itself, so that he may not be led into it, or may not be overcome by it. 31. Perfect and sincere charity, which is from a pure heart and a good conscience, and from faith unfeigned, as well in catechumens as in penitents, may be without the remission of sins. 32. That charity, which is the fulfilment of the law, is not always combined with the remission of sins. 33. The catechumen lives justly, righteously, and in a holy manner, and observes the commands of God, and fulfils the law through charity, before he has obtained remission of sins, which is at length received in the fount of baptism. 34. That distinction of twofold love, to wit, the natural, with which God is loved as the author of nature, and of gratuitous love, with which God is loved as the beatifier, is idle and fictitious, and devised to mock the sacred writings, and very many testimonies of the ancients. 35. Everything soever which a sinner does, or a slave of sin, is a sin. 36. Natural love, which springs from the powers of nature, from philosophy alone, to the upraising of human presumption with injury to the cross of Christ, is defended by some doctors. 37. He thinks with Pelagius who recognizes any natural good, that is, any which derives its origin from the sole powers of nature. 38. Every love of the creature is a rational or vicious desire with which the world is loved, which is prohibited by John, or that praiseworthy charity, with which, diffused in the heart by the Holy Spirit, God is loved. 39. What is done voluntarily, even though it be done necessarily, still is done freely. 40. In all his acts the sinner is subservient to a predominant desire. 41. That measure of liberty which is from necessity, is not found in the Scriptures under the name of liberty, but only the name of liberty from sin. 42. Justice, by which the wicked man is justified by faith, consists formally in obedience to the commands, which is the justice of works, but not in any grace infused into the soul, by which man is adopted as the son of God, and is renewed according to the interior man, and is rendered a sharer in the Divine nature, that, so renewed by the Divine Spirit, he may afterwards live well, and obey the commands of God. 43. In penitent men before the sacrament of absolution, and in catechumens before baptism, there is true justification; separate, however, from the remission of sins. 44. By most of the works which are done by the faithful merely that they may obey the commands of God, such as to obey parents, to return a deposit, to abstain from homicide, theft, fornication, men are indeed justified, because they are obedience to the law, and true justice of the law; by these, however, they do not obtain increase of virtues. 45. The sacrifice of the mass is a sacrifice in no other way than in that general way by which every work is so, which is done that man may cling unto God by a holy alliance. 46. Voluntary appertains not to the notion and definition of sin; nor is it a question of definition, but of cause and origin, whether every sin ought to be voluntary. 47. Whence the sin of origin has truly in it regard to sin, without any regard and respect to the will, from which it had its origin. 48. The sin of origin is voluntary by the habitual will of the child, and habitually prevails in that child, because a contrary choice of the will is not maintained. 49. And from the habitual will prevailing, it happens that the child departing without the sacrament of regeneration, when he shall have attained the use of reason, actually holds God as an object of hatred, blasphemes God, and resists the law of God. 50. Evil desires, to which reason does not consent, and to which man is reluctantly subject, are prohibited by the commandment, Thou shalt not covet. 51. Concupiscence, or the law of the members, and its wicked desires which men unwillingly feel, are true disobedience to the law. 52. Every wickedness is of that condition, that it may infect its author and all posterity in that manner in which the first transgression infected. 53. As far as it depends on the force of transgression, so much of bad deserts do they contract from the parent who are born with lesser vices, as those who are born with greater. 54. This decisive sentence, that God commanded nothing impossible to man, is falsely attributed to Augustin, whilst it belongs to Pelagius. 55. God could not from the beginning create man such as he is now born. 56. In sin there are two things, act and guilt; but the act passing away, nothing remains but the guilt, or the obligation to punishment. 57. Whence in the sacrament of baptism or the absolution of the priest, the guilt of sin only is taken away, and the ministry of the priests alone frees from sin. 58. The penitent sinner is not enlivened by the ministering of the priest absolving, but by God alone, who, suggesting and inspiring penitence, quickeneth and resuscitates him, but by the ministry of the priest the guilt is only taken away. 59. When by almsgivings and other works of penitence, we satisfy God for temporal punishments, we do not offer to God a condign price for our sins, as some erring persons think (for otherwise we should be, at least in some measure, redeemers), but we do something in regard of which the satisfaction of Christ is applied and communicated to us. 60. Through the sufferings of the saints, communicated in indulgences, our transgressions are strictly redeemed, but by the communion of charity their sufferings are imparted to us, that we may be worthy to be free from the punishments due for sins by the price of Christ’s blood. 61. That distinction of doctors, that the commands of the divine law are fulfilled in two ways,—in one way with respect merely to the substance of the works enjoined; in the other, in reference to a certain manner, according to which they may be conducive to lead the person performing them to the eternal kingdom (that is, after the maner of merits), is fictitious and to be exploded. 62. That distinction, also, by which a work is said to be good in two ways, either because from the object and all the circumstances it is directly good (which they used to call morally good), or because it is deserving of the eternal kingdom for this reason, because it is from a living member of Christ through the spirit of charity, is to be rejected. 63. But that distinction also of double justice—of the one, which takes place through the in-dwelling spirit of charity; of the other, which is formed from the inspiration of the Holy Spirit exciting the heart to repentance, but not yet dwelling in the heart, and diffusing charity in it, by which the justification of the divine law may be fulfilled, is in like manner rejected. 64. In like manner, also, that distinction of a twofold quickening,—the one, by which the sinner is quickened, whilst repentance and the purpose and commencement of a new life is inspired into him by the grace of God; of the other, by which he who is truly justified is quickened, and rendered a shoot in the vine by Christ, is equally fictitious, and not at all agreeable to the Scriptures. 65. Any good or not bad use of a free will can be admitted only by a Pelagian error, and he who so thinks and teaches commits an outrage against the grace of Christ. 66. Violence alone is incompatible with the natural liberty of man. 67. Man sins even to his own damnation in that which he does through necessity. 68. Infidelity purely negative in those in whom Christ is not preached is a sin. 69. The justification of the ungodly is made formally by obedience to the law, but not by the secret communication and inspiration of grace, which may cause those justified through it to fulfil the law. 70. Man being in mortal sin, or in the guilt of eternal damnation, may have true charity, and even perfect charity may be compatible with the guilt of eternal damnation. 71. By contrition, even joined with perfect charity, and with a desire to receive the sacrament, crime is not remitted, exclusive of the case of necessity or martyrdom, without the actual receiving of the sacrament. 72. All the afflictions of the just are entirely revenge for their sins; whence Job and the martyrs suffered what they did suffer for their sins. 73. No one but Christ is without original sin; hence the Blessed Virgin died on account of the sin contracted from Adam, and all her afflictions in this life, as of the other just also, were revenge for actual or original sin. 74. Concupiscence in those born again who relapsed into mortal sin, in whom it is now predominant, is a sin, as are also other evil habits. 75. The evil emotions of concupiscence are, for the state of man corrupted, prohibited by the commandment, Thou shalt not covet; whence man feeling them, and not consenting, transgresses the commandment, Thou shalt not covet, although the transgression may not be set down as sin. 76. As long as anything of carnal concupiscence is in one loving, he does not perform the commandment, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with thy whole heart. 77. The laboured satisfactions of the justified avail not condignly to expiate the temporal punishment which remains after guilt is pardoned. 78. The immortality of the first man was not a benefit of grace, but a natural condition. 79. The opinion of doctors is false, that the first man could be created by God, and instituted without natural justice. Which opinions, indeed, having been strictly examined before us, although some of them might be sustained by some means, in the strict and proper sense of the words intended by the assertors, we condemn, circumscribe, and abolish, by the authority of these presents, as heretical, erroneous, suspicious, rash, scandalous, and as giving offence to pious ears respectively, and all things soever that may be published regarding them by word and by writing; and we interdict to all persons soever the power of hereafter speaking, writing, and disputing in any manner soever regarding the same and such like. Whosoever shall act in the contrary way, etc. Given at Rome, at Saint Peter’s, in the year of the incarnation of our Lord 1567, on the calends of October, on the second year of our pontificate. III.—Condemnation of the errors of Jansenius Bull of Innocentius X. against the Five Propositions Innocentius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to all the faithful in Christ, health and apostolical benediction. When, on the occasion of the printing of a book entitled, The Augustinus of Cornelius Jansenius, bishop of Ypres, among other opinions of his, a controversy arose, especially in Gaul, regarding five of them: several bishops of Gaul urged upon us, that we should duly consider the same propositions presented to us, and that we should deliver a defined and clear judgment concerning each one of them. But the tenor of the above-named propositions is as follows:— 1. Some commands of God are impossible to just men, though willing and endeavouring (to fulfil them), according to the strength they possess at present; the grace also is deficient, by which they may become possible. 2. Inward grace in the state of fallen nature is never resisted. 3. To merit and to demerit in a state of fallen nature, freedom from necessity is not required in man, but freedom from compulsion is sufficient. 4. The Semipelagians admitted the necessity of preventing inward grace for single acts, even for the beginning of faith, and in this they were heretics, that they would have it that that grace was such, as human will might resist or comply with. 5. It is semipelagian to say, that Christ died or shed his blood for all men entirely. We, who, amid the manifold cares which constantly harass our mind, were especially anxious that the church of God committed to us from on high, the errors of depraved opinions being removed, might proceed in safety, and as a ship in a calm sea, the waves and storms of all tempests being appeased, might sail on in security, and gain the wished-for haven of salvation, considering the importance of the thing, in the presence of some cardinals of the holy Roman Church, specially and frequently assembled for the purpose, and in the presence of several masters in sacred theology, caused the same five propositions presented to us as above to be carefully examined one by one, and we maturely considered their suffrages, taken as well vivâ voce as in writing, and heard the same masters, various assemblies having been held in our presence, descanting at full length on the same, and on each one of them. But when from the commencement of such discussions, we both privately and also publicly indicted the prayers of the many faithful in Christ to implore the divine aid, the same being afterwards repeated with still greater fervour, and the presence of the Holy Ghost being anxiously implored by us; at length, by favour of the Divine Being, we came to the declaration and definition below written. The first of the aforesaid propositions: Some commandments of God are impossible to just men, though willing and endeavouring, according to the present strength which they possess; they even want the grace by which they may become possible: we declare to be rash, impious, blasphemous, condemned with anathema and heretical, and as such we condemn it. The second: Inward grace in a state of fallen nature is never resisted: we declare to be heretical, and as such condemn it. The third: To merit and to demerit in a state of fallen nature, freedom from necessity is not required in man, but freedom from compulsion suffices: we declare to be heretical, and as such we condemn it. The fourth: The Semipelagians admitted the necessity of preventive interior grace for every single act, even for the beginning of faith, and in this they were heretics, because they would have that grace to be such, as that human will could resist or comply with it: we declare to be false and heretical, and as such condemn it. The fifth: It is semipelagian to say, that Christ died or shed his blood for all men: we declare to be false, rash, scandalous, and understood in that sense, that Christ died for the salvation only of the predestined, impious, blasphemous, contumelious, derogating from divine goodness, and heretical, and as such we condemn it. We command, therefore, all the faithful in Christ, of both sexes, that they presume not to think of the aforesaid propositions, to teach, to preach otherwise than is contained in this our present declaration and definition, under the censures and penalties expressed in the law against heretics and their abettors. We equally instruct all patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, and other ordinaries of places, as also all inquisitors into heretical perverseness, by all means to restrain and keep in check all contradictory and rebellious persons whatsoever by censures and the penalties aforesaid, and the other convenient remedies of law and fact, the aid of the secular arm being called in for this purpose, if it should be necessary. Not intending, however, by this declaration and definition, made on the five aforesaid propositions, to approve in any degree other opinions, which are contained in the aforesaid book of Cornelius Jansenius. Given at Rome, at Saint Mary Major’s, in the year of the incarnation of our Lord 1653, the day before the calends of June, the ninth year of our pontificate. Condemnation of the errors of Paschasius Quesnell Bull of Clement X. Clement, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to all the faithful in Christ, health and apostolical benediction. The only-begotten Son of God, for our salvation and that of the whole world, having become the son of man, whilst he was instructing his disciples in the doctrine of truth, and educating his whole Church in the apostles, arranging the present and providing for the future, by a splendid and most wholesome lesson admonished us, that we should take heed from false prophets, who come to us in sheep’s clothing, in whose name chiefly are pointed out those lying masters, and dealers in deception, who lurkingly insinuating their perverse dogmas under the splendid garb of piety, introduce sects of perdition under the show of sanctity, and that they may steal the more easily on the incautions, as if laying aside the wolf’s skin, and wrapping themselves up in the sentences of the divine law, as in the fleeces of sheep, wickedly abuse the words of the holy Scriptures, and accordingly those of the New Testament itself, which they wrest in many ways to their own destruction and that of others; taught forsooth by the example and tutorage of the old father of lies, from whom they are descended, that there is no shorter or readier way to deceive, than that where the fraud of nefarious error is surreptitiously introduced, there the authority of the divine word should be held out as a pretext. Instructed by these truly divine admonitions, as soon as we heard, not without the innermost bitterness of our heart, that a certain book some time since printed in the French language, and distributed into several volumes, entitled, “Le Nouveau Testament en François, avec des reflexions morales sur chaque vers, etc., à Paris, 1699:” otherwise: “Abrégé de la morale de l’Evangile, des Actes des Apôtres, des Epîtres de S. Paul, des Epîtres canoniques et de l’Apocalypse; ou Pensées chrétiennes sur le texte de ces livres sacres, etc., à Paris, 1693 et 1694,” though previously condemned by us, and blending in many ways the lies of perverse doctrines with Catholic truths, was still considered by many as free from any error, was in every direction forced into the hands of the faithful of Christ, and was disseminated everywhere with too much avidity by the contrivance and exertions of some always striving for innovation, having been even rendered into Latin, in order that the contagion of the pernicious instruction may if possible pass from nation to nation, and from kingdom to kingdom, we felt the greatest concern that the flock of the Lord intrusted to our charge should be imperceptibly led away into the road of perdition by wily seductions and fraud of this kind, and excited not less by the incentives of our pastoral solicitude, than by the frequent complaints of orthodox believers, but especially by the letters and entreaties of several of our venerable brethren, particularly of the bishops of Gaul, we have determined to oppose by some more effectual remedy the spreading disease, which might even at some future time induce still worse consequences. And on directing our careful attention to the consideration of the very cause of the evil, we clearly discovered that the chief ruin from this book progressed and gained strength mainly because it lay concealed within, and like foul corruption cannot obtain vent except by cutting down on the ulcer, as the book itself at its first appearance entices its readers by a certain show of piety; for its words are rendered as it were emollient with oil, whilst they are in reality arrows, and coming from a well-strung bow, so prepared for mischief, that they transfix in secret those straight of heart. Accordingly we thought that nothing more opportune or more conducive to health could be done by us than if we were to present a more distinct and clear exposition of the fallacious doctrine of the book, which hitherto has been merely alluded to in a general way by us, by selecting from it several propositions one by one, and by uprooting from the middle of the wheat with which they were covered, and placing before the eyes of all the faithful of Christ the noxious seeds of the tares. Thus, forsooth, the errors being laid bare and openly exposed, not indeed one or two of them, but a great many of them, and those of the most serious import, both those which were formerly condemned, and also those newly devised, we plainly trust that with God’s blessing all will at length be forced to yield to the open and manifest truth. That this same measure would contribute very much to the Catholic interest, and that it would be of singular efficacy in quieting the dissensions which have arisen, more especially in the flourishing kingdom of Gaul, from the varying bent of different minds which seemed inclined to proceed to still more serious lengths—that it would prove extremely useful, and in a manner necessary for effecting the peace of conscience, we have been repeatedly assured not only by the bishops above mentioned, but also by our particularly dear son in Christ, Lewis the most Christian king of the French, whose extraordinary zeal in defending the purity of the Catholic faith, and in extirpating errors, we cannot sufficiently commend, he having repeatedly evinced acts of duty truly pious and highly becoming a most Christian prince, and having most earnestly called on us, that we should consult for the urgent necessity of souls by promulgating with all speed the censure of our apostolical judgment. Hence confiding in the favour of the Lord, and in his heavenly aid, we have set about the salutary work with that sedulous and diligent care which the importance of the task demands, and having faithfully extracted very many propositions from the aforesaid book according to the editions above recounted respectively, propositions expressed both in the Latin and French idiom, we have commanded them to be discussed carefully by several masters in sacred theology, first indeed in presence of two of our venerable brethren, cardinals of the holy Roman Church, but then in presence of ourselves, the counsel of several other cardinals being also invited, with the greatest care and maturity; a collation moreover of each and every one of the propositions being most scrupulously made with the text of the book itself, and several to be well weighed and examined in different and repeated congregations. The hundred and one condemned propositions are as follow: 1. What else remaineth unto the soul which has lost God and his grace, save only sin, and the consequences of sin, proud poverty and lazy indigence, that is a general incapacity for labour, for prayer, and for every good work. This proposition is found in the moral observations of Quesnell, on Luke 16:3. 2. The grace of Jesus Christ, the efficient beginning of good of every kind soever, is necessary for every good work; without it not only nothing is done, but likewise nothing can be done. On John 15:5. Ed. 1693. 3. In vain, O Lord, dost thou command, if thou thyself givest not what thou commandest. Acts 16:10. 4. Thus, O Lord, are all things possible to him, to whom thou makest all things possible, by working the same things in him. Mark 9:22. 5. When God softeneth not the heart by the inward anointing of his grace, exhortations and outward graces serve not, save to harden it the more. Rom. 9:18. Ed. 1693. 6. The difference between the Jewish and Christian covenant is, that in the former God requireth the shunning of sin, and the fulfilment of the law from the sinner, by leaving him in his own incapability; but in the latter, God giveth unto the sinner that which he commandeth, by purifying him with his own grace. Rom. 11:27. 7. What advantage for men is there in the old covenant, in which God left him to his own infirmities, imposing upon him his own law? But what happiness is it not to be admitted into a covenant, in which God doth bestow on us that which he seeketh from us? Hebr. 8:7. 8. We appertain not unto the new covenant, save in as far as we are partakers of the new grace thereof, which worketh within us that which God doth enjoin unto us. Hebr. 8:10. 9. The grace of Christ is the supreme grace, without which we are never able to confess Christ, and with which we never can deny him. 1 Cor. 12:3. 1693. 10. Grace is the operation of the hand of Almighty God, which nothing can hinder or retard. Matt. 20:34. 11. Grace is nothing else than the will of Almighty God, ordering, and doing that which he doth order. Mark 2:11. 12. When God willeth to save a soul, at what time and in what place soever, the effect unhesitatingly followeth the will of God. Ibid. 13. When God willeth to save a soul, and toucheth it with the inward hand of his grace, no human will can resist him. Luke 5:13. 1693. 14. How far soever an obstinate sinner be removed from salvation, when Jesus presenteth himself to be beheld by him in the salutary light of his grace, it must be that he give himself up, run forward, humble himself, and adore his Saviour. Mark 5. 1693. 15. When God accompanieth his command, and his outward speaking, by the anointing of his spirit and the inward force of his grace, he worketh in him that obedience which he seeketh. Luke 9:60. 16. There are no delights which yield not to the delights of grace, seeing that nothing resisteth the Almighty. Acts 8:12. 17. Grace is that voice of the Father, which inwardly teacheth men, and maketh them come unto Jesus Christ; and whosoever cometh not unto him after he hath heard the outward voice of the Son, is in no wise instructed of the Father. John 6:45. 18. The seed of the word, which the hand of God watereth, ever bringeth forth its fruit. Acts 11:21. 19. The grace of God is nothing else but his almighty will: this is the idea which God himself hath handed down to us in all his scriptures. Rom. 14:4. 1693. 20. The true idea of grace is, that God wills that he be obeyed by us, and is obeyed; commandeth, and all things are done; the Lord but speaketh, and all things are subjected unto him. Mark 4:39. 21. The grace of Jesus Christ is a strong, powerful, supreme, invincible grace, inasmuch as it is the operation of the Almighty will, the following and imitation of the operation of God, incarnating and raising again his son. 2 Cor. 5:21. 1693. 22. The agreement of the almighty will of God in the heart of man with the free consent of his own will, is straightway proved unto us in the incarnation, as a fount and archetype of all other operations of mercy and grace, all which are gratuitous, and so depending upon God, as the original operation itself. Luke 1:48. 23. God himself hath delivered unto us the idea of the almighty operation of his grace, signifying it by that which Produceth creatures out of nothing, and restoreth life to the dead. Rom. 4:17. 24. The just idea which the centurion has of the omnipotence of God and Jesus Christ in healing bodies by the sole motion of his will, is the image of the idea which ought to be held touching the omnipotence of his grace in healing souls from avarice. Luke 7:7. 25. God illuminates the soul, and healeth it as well as the body, by his will alone; he commandeth, and he is obeyed. Luke 18:42. 26. No graces are given, save through faith. Luke 8:48. 27. Faith is the first grace, and the fountain of all others. 2 Pet. 1:3. 28. The first grace which God grants to a sinner, is the remission of sins. Mark 11:25. 29. Beyond the Church no grace is granted. Luke 10:35–6. 30. All whom God willeth to save through Christ, are infallibly saved. John 6:40. 31. The desires of Christ always have their effect; he bringeth peace into the inwardest parts of [men’s] hearts, when he wisheth it for them. John 20:19. 32. Jesus Christ delivered himself unto death, to liberate for ever by his blood the first born, that is, the elect, from the hand of the destroying angel. Gal. 4:4, 5, 6, 7. 33. Alas! How doth it behove a man to have renounced earthly goods, and even himself, that he may, so to speak, have confidence to appropriate Christ unto himself, his love, death, and mysteries, as doth holy Paul, when he saith: who loved me, and gave himself for me. Gal. 2:20. 34. The grace of Adam only produced human merits: 2 Cor. 5:21. 1693. 35. The grace of Adam is the sequel of creation, and was due to a healthy and intact nature. 2 Cor. 5:21. 36. The essential difference between the grace of Adam and a state of innocence, and Christian grace, is, that every one soever would have received the first in his own person; but the other is not received, save in the person of Jesus Christ raised from the dead, to whom we are united. Rom. 7:4. 37. The grace of Adam, by sanctifying him in himself, was proportioned to him; the Christian grace, by sanctifying us in Jesus Christ, is omnipotent, and worthy the Son of God. Eph. 1:6. 38. A sinner is not free, save unto evil, without the grace of him that freeth. Luke 8:9. 39. The will, which grace preventeth not, hath no light, save to lead astray; no warmth, save to hurry itself headlong; no strength, save to wound itself; is capable of every evil, and incapable of any good. Matth. 20:3, 4. 40. Without grace we can love nothing, save unto our condemnation. 2 Thess. 3:18. 1693. 41. All knowledge of God, even natural, even among Pagan philosophers, cannot come, save from God, and without grace it produceth nought save presumption, vanity, and opposition to God himself, instead of the affections of adoration, gratitude, and love. Rom. 1:19. 42. The grace of Christ alone renders man fit for the sacrifice of faith; without this is nothing but impurity; nothing but unworthiness. Acts 11:9. 43. The first effect of baptismal grace is to cause that we be so dead unto sin, that our spirit, heart, senses have no more of life for sin than a dead man has for the things of the world. Rom. 6:2. 1693. 44. There are but two loves, from whence all our wills and actions spring: the love of God, which does all things for the sake of God, and which God rewards; and the love by which we love ourselves and the world, which refers not to God what should be referred to God, and on this very account is evil. John 5:29. 45. The love of God no longer reigning in the heart of sinners, it is necessary that carnal desire reign in it, and corrupt all his actions. Luke 15:13. 1693. 46. Avarice or charity renders the use of the senses good or bad. Matth. 5:28. 47. Obedience to the law ought to proceed from a fountain, and this fountain is charity. When the love of God is its inward beginning, and the glory of God its end, then that is pure which appeareth outwardly: otherwise it is nought but hypocrisy or false righteousness. Matt. 25:26. 1693. 48. What else can we be, but darkness, but wandering, and sin, without the light of faith, without Christ, and without charity. Eph. 5:8. 49. As no sin is without our own self-love, so is no good work without the love of God. Mark 7:22, 23. 50. In vain do we cry unto God, “my father,” if that which crieth be not the spirit of charity. Rom. 8:15. 51. Faith justifieth, when it operates; but it does not itself operate, save through charity. Acts 8:39. 52. All other means of salvation are contained in faith, is in its own proper germ and seed; but this faith is not apart from love and confidence. Acts 10:43. 53. Charity alone in Christian wise maketh [actions Christian] through relation to God and Jesus Christ. Coloss. 3:14. 54. It is charity alone which speaketh unto God; God heareth his alone. 1 Cor. 8:1. 55. God crowneth nought but charity; he that runneth from another impulse or motive runneth in vain. 1 Cor. 9:24. 56. God rewardeth only charity, because charity alone honoureth God. Matth. 25:36. 57. Everything is wanting to the sinner, when hope is wanting to him; and there is no hope in God, where there is not the love of God. Matth. 27:5. 58. Neither God, nor religion, is there, where charity is not. 1 John 4:8. 59. The prayer of the ungodly is a new sin, and what God [thereupon] doth grant to them, is a new judgment against them. John 10:25. 1693. 60. If the fear of punishment alone excites penitence, the more violent it (penitence) is, so much the more doth it lead to desperation. Matth. 27:5. 61. Fear restraineth but the hand, but the heart is devoted to sin so long as it is not led by the love of justice. Luke 20:19. 62. He who abstains not from evil, save through the fear of punishment, commits that [evil] in his heart, and is already guilty before God. Matth. 21:46. 63. The baptized is still under the law, as the Jew, if he fulfil not the law, or fulfil it from fear only. Rom. 6:14. 64. Under the malediction of the law, good never happens, because sin is committed either by doing evil, or by avoiding it only through fear. Gal. 5:26. 65. Moses, the prophets, the priests, and doctors of the law, are dead, save in that they have given any son unto God, seeing they have not effected, save only slaves unto fear. Mark 7:19. 66. He who will fain approach God, must neither come unto him with brutish passions, nor be led by natural instinct, or by fear, like beasts, but by faith and love, as sons. Hebr. 7:26. 1693. 67. Slavish fear does not represent God unto itself, but as a hard, imperious, unjust, untractable master. Luke 19:21. 1693. 68. The goodness of God hath shortened the way unto salvation, by closing up the whole [matter] in faith and in prayers. Acts 2:21. 69. Faith, the use, increase, and reward of faith, is all the gift of the pure liberality of God. Mark 9:22. 70. God never afflicts the innocent, and afflictions always serve either to punish sin, or to purify the sinner. John 9:3. 71. Man for his own preservation may give himself a dispensation from that law which God founded for his advantage. Mark 2:28. 72. The mark of the Christian Church is, that it is catholic, comprehending both all the angels of heaven, and all the elect, and the just of the earth and of all ages. Hebr. 12:22, 23, 24. 73. What is the Church, but the assemblage of the sons of God, remaining in her bosom, adopted in Christ, subsisting in his person, redeemed with his blood, living in his spirit, acting through his grace, and awaiting the grace of the time to come? 2 Thess. 1:1, 2. 1693. 74. The Church, or the entire Christ, hath the incarnate Word as the head, but all the holy as members. 1 Tim. 3:16. 75. The Church is one sole man, made up of many members, whereof Christ is the head, life, subsistence, and person; one sole Christ made up of many holy, whereof he is the sanctifier. Eph. 2:14, 15, 16. 76. Nothing is more spacious than the Church of God, seeing that all the elect and just of all ages compose it. Eph. 2:22. 77. He who leads not a life worthy a son of God and a member of Christ, ceases meanwhile to hold God as his father, and Christ as his head. 1 John 2:24. 1693. 78. A man is separated from the elect people, of which the Jewish people was a type, and Jesus Christ is the head, as well by not living according to the Gospel, as by not believing the Gospel. Acts 3:23. 79. It is useful and necessary at every time, in every place, and for every kind of persons, to study and know the spirit, piety, and mysteries of sacred Scripture. 1 Cor. 14:5. 80. The reading of sacred Scripture is for all. Acts 8:28. 81. The obscurity of the holy word of God is not a reason for the laity to excuse themselves from the reading thereof. Acts 8:31. 82. The Lord’s day ought to be sanctified by Christians with the readings of piety, and above all, of the holy Scriptures. It is damnable to wish to restrain a Christian from such reading. Acts 15:21. 83. It is an illusion to persuade oneself that a knowledge of the mysteries of religion ought not to be communicated to females by the reading of the sacred books. The abuse of the Scriptures has arisen, and heresies have sprung up, not from the simplicity of women, but from the haughty knowledge of men. John 4:26. 84. To snatch the New Testament out of the hands of Christians, or to keep it closed to them, by taking from them that method of understanding it, is to shut the mouth of Christ against them. Matt. 5:2. 85. To interdict to Christians the reading of sacred Scripture, especially of the Gospel, is to interdict the use of light to the sons of light, and to cause them to suffer a certain kind of excommunication. Luke 11:33. 1693. 86. To snatch from the simple people this consolation, of joining their voice to the voice of the whole Church, is a custom contrary to the apostolic practice, and to the intention of God. 1 Cor. 14:16. 87. The manner full of wisdom, light, and charity, is, to give souls time to bear and feel a state of sin with humility, to seek a spirit of penitence and contrition, and to begin, at least, to satisfy the justice of God, before they are reconciled. Acts 8:9. 88. We know not what is sin and true penitence, when we wish to be straightway restored to the possession of those goods of which sin hath despoiled us, and shun to endure the confusion of that separation. Luke 17:11, 12. 89. The fourteenth step to the conversion of a sinner is, that when he is already reconciled, he has the right of assisting at the sacrifice of the Church. Luke 15:23. 1693. 90. The Church hath authority to excommunicate, so that it may exercise the same through its chief pastors, with the consent, at least, first obtained, of the whole body. Matt. 18:17. 91. The fear of unjust excommunication ought never to hinder us from fulfilling our duty; we are never [effectually] removed from the Church, even when we seem expelled from it by the wickedness of men, seeing we are by charity affixed to God, Jesus Christ, and the Church itself. John 9:22, 23. 92. Rather to suffer excommunication and unjust anathema in peace, than to betray the truth, is to imitate the holy Paul; so far is it from being [so] to upraise oneself against authority, or to sever unity. Rom. 9:3. 93. Jesus doth sometimes heal wounds, which the headlong haste of the chief pastors inflicts without his command. Jesus restoreth what they themselves have severed through inconsiderate zeal. John 18:11. 94. Nothing excites a worse opinion of the Church among its enemies, than to see dominion exercised therein over the faith of the faithful, and that divisions should be cherished on account of matters which harm neither faith nor manners. Rom. 14:16. 95. To such a pass have truths come, that they are, as it were, a foreign tongue unto most Christians, and the manner of preaching them is as an unknown dialect, so removed is it from the simplicity of the apostles, and so beyond the common understanding of the faithful; nor is it sufficiently perceived, that this falling off is one of the most sensible signs of the old age of the Church, and of the anger of God against his sons. 1 Cor. 14:21. 1699. 96. God permits that all powers be opposed to the preachers of the truth, to the end that his victory may be attributed only to the Divine grace. Acts 17:8. 97. It too often happens, that those members which are more holily and more strictly united to the Church, are looked upon and treated as unworthy, so that they should be in the Church, even as separated from it; but the just lives by faith, and not from the opinion of men. Acts 4:11. 98. The state of persecution and punishments, which any one endures, as if a wicked and impious heretic, is, for the most part, the last and most meritorious probation, as being the one which renders a man most like unto Jesus Christ. Luke 22:37. 99. Pertinacity, prevention, obstinacy in being unwilling either to examine anything, or to perceive that one has been deceived, do daily, in the case of many, change into the odour of death that which God placed in his Church to be therein the odour of life, to wit, good books, instructions, holy examples, &c. 2 Cor. 2:16. 100. The deplorable season, in which it is believed that God is honoured by persecuting truth and its disciples, this time hath arrived.… To be held and treated by the ministers of religion as impious, and unworthy all commerce with God, as a rotten member, capable of corrupting all in the society of the holy, is, for pious men, a death more terrible than the death of the body. In vain does any one flatter himself respecting the purity of his intentions, and a certain zeal for religion, by persecuting good men with fire and sword, if he is blinded by his own passion, or carried away by another’s, because he is unwilling to examine anything. We frequently believe we sacrifice the impious one to God, and sacrifice the servant of God to the devil. John 16:2. 101. Nothing is more opposed to the Spirit of God, and the teaching of Jesus Christ, than to make common oaths in the Church, seeing this is to multiply the opportunities for perjury, to stretch out snares for the weak and uneducated, and to cause that the name and truth of God some time serve the counsel of the wicked. Matt. 5:37. Having heard, therefore, the suffrages of the above-mentioned cardinals and other theologians exhibited to us both by word of mouth as well as in writing, and having invoked the protection of the divine light by proclaiming private and public prayers to that end, we by this our constitution, destined to be in effect for ever, declare, condemn, and reprobate all and each of the previously inserted propositions as false, captious, ill-sounding, offensive to pious ears, scandalous, pernicious, rash, injurious to the Church and her practice, and contumelious not only to the Church, but also to the secular powers; seditious, impious, blasphemous, suspected of heresy, and savouring of heresy itself, and also as abetting heretics and heresies, and also schism, erroneous, near akin to heresy, several times condemned, and finally heretical, and manifestly renewing respectively various heresies, and those particularly which are contained in the infamous propositions of Jansenius, taken, however, in that sense in which they have been condemned. We command all the faithful in Christ of both sexes not to presume to think of the aforesaid propositions, to teach them, to preach them otherwise than is contained in this same our constitution; so that whosoever shall teach, defend, publish them or any of them, conjointly or separately, or shall treat of them publicly or privately, even by way of disputing, unless perhaps for the purpose of impugning them, let him by the very fact, without other declaration, lie under ecclesiastical censures, and other penalties enacted by law against those perpetrating such acts. But by the express reprobation of the aforesaid propositions, we do not by any means intend to approve of other things contained in the same book, especially since in the course of examination we detected in it several other propositions similar and near akin to those which have been condemned as above, and imbued with the same errors, and indeed not a few encouraging disobedience and obstinacy under a certain imaginary pretext of persecution, which is as it were spreading at the present day, and crying those up under the false name of Christian forbearance; which therefore to recount individually we considered to be both too tedious and by no means necessary, and finally, a thing which is still more intolerable, the sacred text of the New Testament itself corrupted in a manner deserving of condemnation, and conformable in many respects to the other Gallican version (Montensi) long since reprobated; but in many ways differing and wandering from the Vulgate edition, which has been approved in the Church by the experience of so many ages, and which ought to be accounted by all the orthodox as authentic, and in many ways wrested into strange, exotic, and oftentimes injurious senses, not without the greatest perversity. The same book, therefore, as being one which by its sweet words and benedictions, as the apostle says, that is, which, under the false semblance of pious instruction, is well calculated for leading astray the hearts of the innocent, whether bearing the preceding title, or any other title whatsoever, wheresoever, or in what other language soever, or in what edition soever, or version hitherto printed, or hereafter to be printed (which Heaven forbid), by apostolic authority, by the tenor of these presents we once more prohibit and in like manner condemn, as also all other books, and every such book published in its defence, whether in manuscript or in print, or perhaps (which God avert) books or pamphlets to be published, and the reading, copying, the retaining and use of such we prohibit in like manner, and interdict to all and every one of the faithful in Christ, under pain of excommunication, to be by the very fact incurred by those acting in a contrary way. We command, moreover, our venerable brethren the patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops, and other ordinaries of places, as also the inquisitors of heretical depravity, that they by all means coerce and keep in check all contradictory and refractory persons whatsoever by the above-mentioned censures and penalties, and by the other remedies of law and fact, the aid of the secular arm being appealed to, if it should be necessary. But we desire, &c. But let it be lawful for no one, &c. In the year of the incarnation of our Lord 1713, 6th of the ides of September, in the 8th year of our pontificate. Pius, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to all the faithful in Christ, health and apostolical benediction. The apostle commands us, beholding Jesus, the author and consummator of our faith, sedulously to consider what and how great contradiction he sustained from sinners against himself, lest, wearied out by hardships and dangers, we may at length fail in our spirits, and in a manner sink. That we be fortified and strengthened by this most wholesome reflection is then most necessary, when against the body itself of Christ, which is the Church, the tide of that dread conspiracy which is never to cease rages more intensely, that comforted by the Lord, and in the power of his might, protected by the shield of faith, we may be able to resist in the evil day, and to extinguish all the fiery weapons of the most unjust. In this commotion of the times, in this most perturbed overturning of all things, all good men have to undergo a serious struggle against all the enemies of the Christian name, of what kind soever; we a still more serious one, on whom, in consideration of the care and management of the entire flock committed to our pastoral solicitude, a greater zeal for the Christian religion is incumbent than upon all others. But in this very weight of the burden which has been placed on our shoulders, that of bearing the burdens of all who are oppressed, the more we are conscious to ourselves of our own weakness, into so much the firmer hope does the divinely established principle of the apostolic duty instituted in the person of Saint Peter, raise and exalt us, that he who was never to abandon the government of the Church once delivered to him by Christ, should not cease to carry the burdens of apostolic government among those whom God had given to him to be protected by perpetual succession, and to be guarded as his heirs. And amid these miseries which surround us on all hands, it has been added as an accumulation of all our other troubles, that from that quarter whence we should rejoice, from thence we should derive greater sorrow; inasmuch as when any governor in the sacred Church of God under the name of priest turns away the very people of Christ from the path of truth into the precipice of a devious persuasion, and this a most noble city, then is our lamentation to be redoubled, and greater anxiety to be felt. It was not truly in distant lands, but in the very central light of Italy, under the eyes of the city, and nigh the threshold of the apostles; it was a bishop distinguished by the honour of a double see (Scipio de Ricini, formerly bishop of Pistoria and Prato), whom, when he came to us for the purpose of taking on him his pastoral function, we embraced with paternal charity, who in turn sealed the attachment and obedience due to us and to this Apostolic See, at the very rite of his sacred ordination, by the sacredness of a solemn oath. And that same person, not long after that, being dismissed from our embrace with the kiss a of peace, he came to the people committed to his care, circumvented by the wiles of the masters of a perverse philosophy assembled around him, began to apply his mind to this, not to defend, cultivate, and perfect, as he ought to do, that praiseworthy and peaceful form of the Christian institution, which former prelates had, according to the ecclesiastical rule, long since introduced, and in a manner established, but on the contrary, under the mask of a feigned reformation, by introducing unseasonable novelties, he disturbed, convulsed, and tore it up from the foundation. Nay more, when even by our exhortation he directed his attention to the diocesan synod, it was effected by his refractory pertinaciousness in his own way of thinking, that from that quarter whence some remedy of the wounds was to be sought, more disastrous ruin sprung forth. Indeed, after this Synod of Pestoria burst forth from its lurking-place, in which it lay concealed for a considerable time, there was no person entertaining a pious and wise sentiment concerning the interests of religion, who did not forthwith perceive that the intention of the authors was, that the seeds of perverse doctrines, which they had before scattered by pamphlets of various kinds, they should condense as it were into one body, should resuscitate errors long since proscribed, and take away credit and authority from the apostolic decrees in which they were proscribed. When we saw that these things, in proportion as they are the more alarming in themselves, so much the more urgently demanded the aid of our solicitude, we hesitated not to turn our attention to the adoption of those measures which should seem to he more suited either to remedy or altogether to check the rising evil. And first, mindful of the wise admonition of our predecessor Zosimus, that those matters which are important called for great weight of examination, we committed the synod first published by the bishop to be examined by four bishops, having attached other theologians also from the secular clergy; then we deputed a congregation also of several cardinals of the holy Roman Church, and of other bishops, who were carefully to examine the whole series of proceedings, to bring together passages separated from each other, to discuss sentences extracted. Whose suffrages we received, expressed before us by word of mouth and by writing, who gave it as their opinion both that the synod was to be universally reprobated, and very many opinions thence collected were deserving of being visited with more or less severe censures, some indeed in themselves, some by the attentive connection of the sentences; on hearing and duly considering their observations, we took care of this also, that certain leading heads of perverse doctrines selected from the entire synod, to which the censurable sentences scattered through the synod chiefly refer, directly or indirectly, might be afterwards reduced to a certain order, and that the censure peculiarly belonging to each should be affixed to the same. But lest evil-minded persons might take occasion for cavilling from this, whether collation of places, or collection of suffrages, however accurately made, in order to meet this calumny which is perhaps already prepared, we determined on having recourse to the prudent measure which our most holy predecessors, as well as most wise prelates, and even general synods, have duly and cautiously adopted in checking the further progress of dangerous and mischievous innovations of this kind, and have left behind them testified and recommended by striking examples. They were well aware of the wily and deceptive tricks of innovators, who, afraid of giving offence to Catholic ears, are oftentimes careful to wrap up the snares of their captious propositions in the subtle coverings of words, that the error lurking amid the difference of meaning may get more easy admission into the mind, and so that the truth of a proposition being upset by the slightest addition or change, the confession of it which was to effect salvation may, by a sort of wily transition, incline to death. And this involved and deceptive mode of arguing is faulty in every kind of discourse, but in a synod is not at all to be tolerated, whose characteristic merit is this, to adhere to that lucid style of speaking in the instruction which it gives, such as may leave behind no danger of offence. If, on such occasions, anything wrong should present itself, it cannot be defended by the artful excuse usually adduced, that any expressions of rather a harsh nature which may fall out anywhere, will be found in other passages more plainly explained, or even corrected, as though the pert flippancy of affirming and denying, and of contradicting themselves ad libitum, which has ever been the fraudulent resource of innovators to indirectly introduce error, might not tend rather to expose error than to palliate or excuse it; or as if illiterate persons more especially, who should fall in perchance with this or that part of the synod set forth to the public in the vernacular tongue, might always have at hand other scattered passages which might have to be inspected; or even after these were inspected, each person might have sufficient means to compare them one with the other, so that, as they idly pretend, they might be able to shun all risk of error. A most baneful trick no doubt for insinuating error, which was some time since wisely detected in the letter of Nestorius, a prelate of Constantinople, and most severely reproved by our predecessor, Celestinus; in which letter, that artful individual was tracked, caught, and held fast, weakening his case by his own verbosity, whilst mixing up that which was true with what are obscure, and again confounding both, he either confessed what had been denied, or endeavoured to deny what had been confessed. To ward off which stratagems, too often resorted to in every age, no better method has been adopted, than that by which, by exposing those passages, which, under the cover of ambiguity, involve a perilous and suspicious discrepance of meanings, their mischievous signification might be marked, under which lurked the error reprobated by the Catholic sense. Which method, abounding in moderation, we too embraced so much the more willingly, as we foresaw that it would rather prove a great aid to reconcile the feelings, and to bring them to the unity of the spirit, in the bonds of peace (which, with the favour of God, we feel pleasure, has justly turned out successful in many cases), to see, first, that the perverse followers of the synod, if any shall remain, which God forbid, may not be able, for the purpose of exciting new disturbances, to attach as partners in their condemnation and associates in guilt the Catholic schools, which, absolutely in spite of them, and plainly resisting, they are endeavouring to draw over to their side by means of a forced similitude of kindred terms in expression, where they find there is any discrepancy in meaning. Then if any unthinking persons have been led astray by any more favourable opinion as yet preconceived regarding the synod, let such persons be deprived of all room for complaint, who, if they possess correct sense, as they wish to appear to do, let them no longer feel annoyed at the condemnation of doctrines so marked, which bear on their front errors from which they themselves profess to be altogether free. Nor even still have we considered that we have gratified our spirit of lenity to our satisfaction, or to speak more truly, our spirit of charity, which urges us towards our brother, whom we would assist with all the means in our power, if it is still possible. For we are urged on by that charity, under the influence of which, our predecessor Celestinus did not refuse to wait for priests to be amended, even against right, or with still greater forbearance, than seemed to be consistent with right. For with Augustine and the fathers of Milevis, we are more willing and desirous that persons holding forth perverse doctrines should be healed by pastoral care in the Church, than that, despairing of salvation, they should be cut off from it, unless some necessity force it. For which end, that no kind of attention may seem to have been neglected to gain over a brother, we deemed it meet that the aforesaid bishop, before we should proceed to ulterior measures, should be invited to come to us, by a most affectionate letter, directed to him by our orders, in which we promised that he should find a kind reception from us and that he should not be prevented from openly and freely expressing whatever might seem to tend to his advantage. Nor indeed had all hope forsaken us that it might happen that if he brought with him a docile mind, which, according to the apostle’s sense, Augustine chiefly required in a bishop, when all contention and asperity being kept aloof, the principal heads of his doctrines should be simply and candidly proposed to him to be reconsidered, such as might have appeared to have called for greater reprehension than he would readily collect himself, and would not hesitate to explain in a more sound sense whatever was put ambiguously, or openly to reject whatever should present the character of manifest perverseness, and thus, with great credit to his own character, as well as to the very great joy of all good persons, the tumults which had arisen in the Church might be put a stop to by the most wished for correction, in the most peaceable manner possible. But now when he, under the pretext of bad health, thought it right not to avail himself of the favour thus offered to him, we can no longer delay the discharge of our apostolic duty. It is not the danger of one or two dioceses only that is in question; the whole church is shaken by any innovation soever. The decision of the supreme Apostolic See is this long time not only expected, but earnestly called for on all sides by repeated entreaties. Heaven forbid that the voice of Peter should ever be silent in that his seat, in which he, perpetually living and presiding, insures to those seeking it the truth of faith. In such cases longer connivance is not safe, because there is almost as much guilt in conniving in such cases as in preaching that which is so contrary to religion. Such a wound, therefore, must be cut away, by which not one limb only is affected, but the whole body of the Church is wounded, and by the aid of the divine goodness care must be taken, that all dissensions being cut off, the Catholic faith be kept inviolate, and those who defend that which is perverse, being reclaimed from error, those whose faith has been approved may be secured by our authority. Wherefore the light of the Holy Ghost being implored with the continual prayers both of ourselves and of the pious followers of Christ, all things being fully and maturely considered, we have given it as our opinion that several propositions, doctrines, sentences, whether given expressly, or insinuated ambiguously, from the acts and decrees of the above-mentioned synod, with their marks and censures, as has been premised, affixed to each, are to be condemned and reprobated, as by this our constitution, which is to hold good for ever, we condemn and reprobate them. They are as follows:— On the obscuration of truths in the church Ex decr. de grat. § 1. I. The proposition, which asserts, “that in these latter ages a general obscuration has been spread over truths of graver moment, regarding religion, and which are the basis of faith, and of the moral doctrine of Jesus Christ:” is heretical. On the power attributed to the community of the church to be communicated through this to the pastors Epist. convoc. II. The proposition, which lays down, “that the power given by God to the Church, to be communicated to the pastors, who are his ministers, for the salvation of souls,” so understood that the power of the ecclesiastical ministry and government is derived from the community of the faithful to the pastors: heretical. On the denomination of ministerial head attributed to the roman pontiff Decret. de fide, § 8. III. Moreover, that which lays down, “that the Roman pontiff is ministerial head,” so explained as that the Roman pontiff receives the power of the ministry not from Christ in the person of Saint Peter, but from the Church, by which, as successor of Peter, true vicar of Christ, and head of the entire Church, he possesses sway in the universal Church: heretical. On the power of the church as to constituting and enforcing external discipline Decret. de fide, §§ 13, 14. IV. The proposition affirming, “that there would be an abuse of the authority of the Church, in transferring it beyond the limits of doctrine and morals, and extending it to externals, and in exacting by force that which depends on persuasion and the heart, and also that it appertains much less to it to exact by force external submission to its decrees,”—in as far as by those indefinite words extending to externals denotes as it were an abuse of the authority of the church, the use of that power received from God, which even the apostles themselves employed in establishing and enforcing external discipline: is heretical. V. In which part it insinuates, that the Church has not the authority of exacting submission to her decrees otherwise than by means which depend on persuasion—in as much as it intends that the Church “has not the power conferred on her by God, not only directing by counsel and persuasion, but also of commanding by laws, and of coercing and compelling the stragglers and contumacious by external judgment and wholesome penalties” (ex Bened. XIV. in a brief ad Assiduas, ann. 1755. To the primate, archbishops, and bishops of the kingdom of Poland): leading to a system otherwise condemned as heretical. Rights granted to bishops contrary to justice Decr. de ord. § 25. VI. The doctrine of the synod, in which it states, “that it is persuaded that the bishop has received from Christ all the rights necessary for the good government of his diocese”—as if to the good government of each diocese superior ordinances were not necessary, regarding whether faith and morals, or general discipline, the right of which is vested in the sovereign pontiffs and general counsels for the universal Church, is schismatical, at least erroneous. VII. Likewise in that, that it exhorts the bishop “to follow up diligently the more perfect establishment of ecclesiastical discipline, and that against all contrary usages, exemptions, reservations, which are adverse to the good order of the diocese, the greater glory of God, and the greater edification of the faithful,”—by this, that it supposes it to be lawful for the bishop, by his own judgment and decision, to determine and decree contrary to usages, exemptions, reservations, whether those which take place in the universal Church, or even in each province, without the permission and interference of a superior hierarchical power, by which they have been introduced or approved, and obtain the force of a law: leading to schism and subversion of hierarchical government, erroneous. VIII. Likewise in this, that it says that it is persuaded “that the rights of the bishop received from Jesus Christ for governing the Church can neither be altered nor impeded; and when it has happened that the exercise of these rights has for any cause been interrupted, that the bishop ever could and ought to revert to his original rights, as often as the greater good of his church requires it,” in as far as it intimates that the exercise of episcopal rights can be impeded or coerced by no superior power whensoever the bishop may by his own judgment think it less expedient for the greater good of his church: leading to schism and the subversion of hierarchical government, erroneous. Right incorrectly granted to priests of inferior orders in decrees of faith and discipline Epist. convoc. IX. The doctrine, which determines, “that the reformation of abuses regarding ecclesiastical discipline in diocesan synods depends equally on the bishop and parish priests, and ought to be strengthened by them, and that without freedom of decision that submission to the suggestion and commands of the bishops:” false, rash, injurious to episcopal authority, subversive of hierarchical government, favouring the Arian heresy introduced anew by Calvin.

Likewise the doctrine, by which parish priests or other priests assembled in synod are pronounced together with the bishop to be judges of faith, and it is intimated at the same time that judgment in causes of faith belongs to them by a peculiar right, and by one indeed received through ordination: False, rash, subversive of hierarchical order, detracting from the strength of the definitions or dogmatic judgments of the Church, at least erroneous. Orat. synod. §. 8. XI. The proposition stating, that by an ancient institute of our ancestors, derived even from the apostolic times, observed through the better ages of the Church, it was received, “that decrees, or definitions, or propositions, even of greater sees, should not be admitted, unless they had been recognized and approved by the diocesan synod:” False, rash, derogating according to its generality from the obedience due to apostolic constitutions, as also from the propositions emanating from superior legitimate hierarchical power, cherishing schism and heresy. Calumnies against some decisions in matter of faith emanating from a considerable number of ages XII. The assertions of the synod, taken collectively, concerning decisions in matter of faith emanating from several ages back, which it represents as decrees originating from one particular church or a few pastors, supported by no sufficient authority, intended for spoiling the purity of faith, and for exciting, turbulence, obtruded by violence, and from wounds which, still too recent, have been inflicted: False, captious, rash, scandalous, injurious to the Roman pontiffs and Church, derogatory from the obedience due to apostolic constitutions, schismatic, pernicious, at least erroneous. Concerning the peace called that of Clement IX Or. synod. § 2, in nota. XIII. A proposition stated among the acts of the synod, which intimates that Clement IX. restored peace to the Church, by the approbation of the distinction of law and fact, prescribed in the subscription of a formulary by Alexander VII.: False, rash, injurious to Clement IX. XIV. But as far as it supports that distinction, by lauding the abettors of the same, and by vituperating their adversaries: Rash, pernicious, injurious to the sovereign pontiff’s, cherishing schism and heresy. On the constitution of the body of the church Append. n. 28. XV. The doctrine which holds forth, “that the Church is to be considered as one mystical body, composed of Christ as head, and of the faithful, who are its members by an infallible union, by which we become in a wonderful manner with him one sole priest, one sole victim, one sole perfect adorer of God the Father in spirit and truth,”—understood in this sense, that to the body of the Church there belong only the faithful, who are perfect adorers in spirit and truth; Heretical. On the state of innocence De grat. §§ 4, 7; de sacr. in gen. § 1; de pœnit. § 4. XVI. The doctrine of the synod on the state of happy innocence, such as it represents it in Adam before sin, embracing not only integrity, but also inward righteousness, with an impulse to God through the love of charity, and primeval sanctity by some means restored after the fall,—so far as, by implication, it intimates that that state was subsequent to creation, a favour due from the natural exigency and condition of human nature, not a gratuitous favour of God: False, otherwise condemned in the case of Baius, and in that of Quesnell, erroneous, favouring the Pelagian heresy. On immortality viewed as a natural condition of man De bapt. § 2. XVII. The proposition stated in these words, “Taught by the apostle, we view death no longer as a natural condition of man, but in reality, as a just punishment of original sin,”—inasmuch as, under the name of the apostle, artfully adduced, it insinuates that death, which in the present state has been inflicted as a just punishment of sin, by the just withdrawal of immortality, had not been a natural condition of man, as if immortality had not been a gratuitous favour, but a natural condition: Captious, rash, injurious to the apostle, otherwise condemned. On the condition of man in a state of nature De grat. § 10. XVIII. The doctrine of the synod, stating, “that after the fall of Adam, God announced the promise of a future redeemer, and wished to console mankind by the hope of salvation, which Jesus Christ was to bring, yet that God wished that mankind should pass through various states, before the fulness of time should come; and first, that in the state of nature, man left to his own lights should learn to distrust his own blind reason, and from his own aberrations should move himself to desire the aid of superior light,”—a doctrine, as it lies, captious, and understood of the desire of the aid of superior light promised in order to salvation through Christ, to conceive which, man, left to his own lights, may be supposed to have been able to move himself: Suspicious, favouring the semi-Pelagian heresy. Of the condition of man under the law Ibid. XIX. Likewise that which subjoins that man under the law, “when he was unable to observe it, had become a transgressor, not indeed through the fault of the law, which was most holy, but through fault of man, who under the law without grace became more and more a transgressor;” and superadds, “that the law, if it did not heal the heart of man, caused that he should know his own evils, and, convinced of his own weakness, he should feel the want of a mediator,”—in which part it intimates generally, that man had become a prevaricator through not observing the law, which he was unable to observe, as if he who is just would command anything which was impossible, or as if he who is merciful would condemn man for that which he could not avoid (ex S. Cæsario, serm. 73, in append. S. Augustini, serm. 273, edit. Maur. Ex S. Aug. de Nat. et Gr. c. 43; De Grat. et Lib. art. c. 16; Enarr. in Psal. 56, n. 1): False, scandalous, impious, condemned in the case of Baius. XX. In which part it is given to be understood, that man under the law without grace could conceive a desire of the grace of a mediator ordained to salvation promised through Christ, as if grace itself did not cause that he be invoked by us (ex Concil. Araus. II., can. 3): A proposition, as it lies, captious, suspicious, favouring the semi-Pelagian heresy. On grace enlightening and exciting De grat. § 11. XXI. A proposition which asserts, “that the light of grace, when it is alone, tends only that we should know the unhappiness of our state, and the serious nature of our evil; that grace in such a case produces the same effect which light produced; therefore, that it is necessary that God should create in our heart a holy love, and inspire a holy delight contrary to the love predominating in us; that this holy love, this holy delight, is properly the grace of Jesus Christ, the inspiration of charity, which, being known, we may act with holy love; that this is that root from which shoot forth good works; that this is the grace of the New Testament, which emancipates us from the slavery of sin, and constitutes us sons of God,”—inasmuch as it intends, that it alone is properly the grace of Jesus Christ, which may create in the heart holy love, and which causes that we act, or also that by which man being freed from the slavery of sin, is constituted the son of God, and the grace of Christ is not properly that grace by which the heart of man is touched by the illumination of the Holy Spirit (Trid. sess. vi. cap. v.), nor does there really exist an interior grace of Christ, which men resist: False, captious, leading into an error condemned in the second proposition of Jansenius, and heretical; and introducing it anew. Of faith as the first grace De fide, § 1. XXII. The proposition which intimates “that faith, from which commences a series of graces, and by which, as the first voice, we are called to salvation and the Church, is itself an excellent virtue of faith, by which men are called faithful, and are so,”—just as if that grace were not prior, which, as it precedes the will, so also precedes faith (ex S. Aug. de Dono Persev. c. 16, n. 41): Suspected of heresy, and savouring of it, otherwise condemned in Quesnellius, erroneous. Of twofold love De grat. § 8. XXIII. The doctrine of the synod concerning the twofold love of predominant desire and predominant charity, stating that man without grace is under the slavery of sin, and that he in that state, by the general influx of predominant desire, infects and spoils all his actions,—in as far as it insinuates, that in man, whilst he is under slavery or in the state of sin, destitute of that grace by which he is freed from the slavery of sin, and constituted son of God, desire so predominates, that by the general influx of this, all his actions are in themselves infected and corrupted, or all the works which are done before justification, by what means soever they may be done, are sins, as if in all his acts the sinner is a slave to predominant desire: False, pernicious, leading into an error condemned as heretical by Trent, again condemned in the case of Baius, art. 40. § 12 XXIV. But in that part in which no intermediate affections are placed between predominant desire and predominant charity, implanted by nature herself, and in their own nature commendable, which, together with the love of beatitude, and the natural inclination to good, have remained as last lineaments, and the mere remains of the image of God (ex S. Aug. de Spir. et lit. c. 28),—just as if between the divine love which leads us to the kingdom, and illicit human love, which is condemned, there existed not lawful human love, which is not censured (ex S. Aug. serm. 349, de Carit. edit. Maur.): False, otherwise condemned. Of servile fear De pœnit. § 3. XXV. The doctrine, which represents that the fear of punishments, in general, can only not be called evil, if at least it tends to restrain the hand, as if the fear itself of hell, which faith teaches, is to be inflicted on sin, is not in itself good and useful, as a supernatural gift, and a motive inspired by God preparing for the love of justice: False, rash, pernicious, injurious to the divine gifts, otherwise condemned, contrary to the doctrine of the Council of Trent, and also to the common understanding of the fathers, that it was necessary, according to the usual order of preparation for justice, that fear may enter first, through which charity may come; fear the medicine, charity the health. (Ex. S. Aug. in Epist. Joan. c. 4, tract. 9, n. 4, 5; in Joan. Evang. tract. 41, n. 10; Enarratione in Psal. 127, n. 7; Sermone 157, de Verbis Apostoli, c. 13; Sermone 161, de Verbis Apostoli, n. 8; Sermone 349, de Caritate, n. 7.) Of the punishment of those dying with original sin alone XXVI. The doctrine, which explodes as a Pelagian fable, that place of the dead (which the faithful designate by the name of the limbo of children) in which the souls of those dying with original sin alone are punished by the punishment of loss, without the punishment of fire;—just as if by this, that those who remove the penalty of fire would introduce that place and middle state, void of guilt and punishment between the kingdom of God and eternal damnation, such as the Pelagians fabled: False, rash, injurious to Catholic schools. Of the sacraments, and first of the sacramental form with the condition annexed De bapt. § 12. XXVII. The deliberation of the synod, in which under the pretext of adhesion to the ancient canons in case of doubtful baptism, it declares its purpose of leaving out mention of the conditional form: Rash, contrary to the practice, law, authority of the Church. Of participation of the victim in the sacrifice of the Mass De euch. § 6. XXVIII. The proposition of the synod, in which, after it sets down that participation of the victim is an essential part of the mass, subjoins: “that it does not condemn as illicit those masses in which those present do not communicate sacramentally, for this reason, because they participate, though less perfectly, of the victim by receiving it in spirit,”—in as far as it insinuates that to the essence of the sacrifice, something is wanting in that sacrifice, which may be done whether no one being present, or those being present, who participate of the victim neither sacramentally nor spiritually, and as if those masses were to be condemned as illicit, in which the priest alone communicating, no one may be present, who communicates either sacramentally or spiritually: False, erroneous, suspected of heresy, and savouring of it. Of the efficacy of the rite of consecration De euch. § 2. XXIX. The doctrine of the synod, in that part where intending to deliver the doctrine of faith on the rite of consecration, those scholastic questions being kept out of view, regarding the manner in which Christ is in the eucharist, from which it exhorts parish priests discharging the office of teaching to abstain, these two points being proposed—1. That Christ, after consecration, is truly, really, and substantially under the species. 2. That then all the substance of bread and wine ceases, the species alone remaining,—entirely omits to make any mention of transubstantiation, or of the conversion of the entire substance of the bread into the body, and the whole substance of the wine into the blood, which, as an article of faith, the Council of Trent defined, and which is contained in the solemn profession of faith, inasmuch as by such unadvised and suspicious omission a knowledge is withdrawn as well of the article pertaining to faith, and also of the term consecrated by the Church to defend the profession of it against heresies, and tends consequently to induce a forgetfulness of it, as though a question merely scholastic were under consideration: Pernicious, derogating from the exposition of Catholic truth regarding the dogma of transubstantiation, favouring heretics. Of the application of the fruit of the sacrifice De euch. § 8. XXX. The doctrine of the synod, in which, whilst it professes “to believe that the oblation of the sacrifice extends to all, so however, that in the liturgy, special commemoration may be made of some, as well living as dead, by praying to God peculiarly for them;” then immediately after it subjoins, “not however that we believe that it is at the option of the priest to apply the fruits of the sacrifice to whom he pleases: nay, we condemn this error, as greatly offending the rights of God, who alone distributes the fruits of the sacrifice to whomsoever he wishes, and according to the measure which is pleasing to him:” whence consequently he traduces it as “a false opinion, introduced among the people, that those who supply alms to the priest on condition that he celebrates one mass, derive a special fruit from it,”—so understood that beside the special commemoration and prayer, the special oblation itself; or application of the sacrifice, which is made by the priest, is not more available, ceteris paribus, to those for whom it is applied, than to any other persons whatsoever, as though no special fruit resulted from the special application, which the Church recommends to be made for certain persons, and orders of persons, and advises to be made specially by the pastors for their sheep; which, as if descending from the divine precept, has been plainly expressed by the sacred Synod of Trent (Sess. 23, cap. 1, de reform. Bened. XIV. Constit. Quum semper oblatas, § 2): False, rash, pernicious, injurious to the Church, leading into an error, otherwise condemned in Wickliff. On observing proper order in worship De euch. § 5. XXXI. The proposition of the synod, stating that it is befitting for the order of the divine offices, and for ancient usage, that in every temple there be only one altar, and consequently that it pleases them to restore that custom: Rash, injurious to the very ancient, pious custom, prevailing many ages since, especially in the Latin Church, and to the approved custom. Ibid XXXII. Likewise the prescription forbidding the cases of the sacred relics or flowers being placed on the altars: Rash, injurious to the pious and approved custom of the Church. Ibid. § 6. XXXIII. The proposition of the synod, in which it shows that it desires that the causes should be taken away, by which a forgetfulness of the principles relating to the order of the liturgy was introduced, by recalling it to greater simplicity of rites, by expounding it in the vulgar tongue, and uttering it in a loud voice, as if the prevailing order of the liturgy received by the Church, and in some measure approved, had emanated from a forgetfulness of the principles by which it ought to be regulated: Rash, offensive to pious ears, insulting to the Church, favouring the reproaches of heretics against it. Of the order of penance De pœnit. § 7. XXXIV. The declaration of the synod, in which, after premising that the order of canonical penance was so determined by the Church after the example of the apostles, that it should be common to all, and not only for the punishment of guilt, but chiefly for disposing to grace, adds, “that it in that admirable and august order recognizes the entire dignity of a sacrament so necessary, free from the subtleties which in the course of time have been added to it,”—as if by the order in which, without completing the course of the canonical penance, this sacrament has been wont to be administered through the whole Church, its dignity had been impaired: Rash, scandalous, leading to a contempt of the dignity of the sacrament, as it has been wont to he administered by the whole Church, injurious to the Church itself. De pœnit. § 10, n. 4. XXXV. The proposition conceived in these words: “If charity in the beginning is always weak, from the ordinary way to obtain an increase of this charity, it is meet that the priest should cause those acts of humiliation and penance to precede, which were in every age recommended by the Church; to reduce those acts to a few prayers, or to some fact after absolution has been now conferred, seems rather the material desire of preserving to this sacrament the bare name of penance, than an enlightened means, and one suited to augment that fervour of charity which ought to precede absolution; we are indeed very averse to the practice, to be disapproved of, of imposing penances to be fulfilled even after absolution; if all our good works have our defects annexed to them, how much more ought we to dread, lest we incur very many imperfections in the very difficult and momentous work of our reconciliation,” in as far as it intimates that penances which are imposed after absolution, are to be considered rather as a supplement for defects incurred in the work of our reconciliation, than as penances truly sacramental and satisfactory for sins confessed: as if, that the true nature of a sacrament, not the bare name, be preserved, it were necessary, out of the ordinary way, that the acts of humiliation and penance, which are imposed by way of sacramental satisfaction, ought to precede absolution: False, rash, injurious to the common practice of the Church, leading into an error stamped with the brand of heresy in the case of Peter de Osma. Of the previous necessary disposition for admitting penitents to reconciliation De grat. § 15. XXXVI. The doctrine of the synod, after premising, “When unequivocal signs of the love of God prevailing in the heart of man shall be had, that he may be fairly indicated as worthy to be admitted to a participation of the blood of Jesus Christ, which takes place in the sacraments;” it adds, “that the suppositious conversions, which are done by attrition, are wont to be neither effectual nor permanent;” consequently, “that the pastor of souls ought to insist on unequivocal signs of prevailing charity, before he admits his penitents to sacraments,” which signs, as it then says (§ 17), “the pastor will be able to deduce from a steady cessation from sin and his fervour in good works;” which fervour of charity, moreover, it represents (de pœnit. § 10) as a disposition which ought to precede absolution; so understood, that not only imperfect contrition, which everywhere passes under the name of attrition, even that which is joined with love, by which man begins to love God as the fountain of all righteousness, and not only contrition formed by charity, but also the fervour of predominant charity, and that too, proved by long trial, by fervour in good works, may be generally and absolutely required, that a man may be admitted to sacraments, and in particular penitents may be admitted to the benefit of absolution: False, rash, calculated to disturb the quiet of souls, contrary to the practice, safe and approved, in the Church, detracting from and injurious to the efficacy of the sacrament. Of the authority to absolve De pœnit. § 10, n. 6. XXXVII. The doctrine of the synod, which regarding the authority to absolve, received by ordination, says, “After the establishment of dioceses and of parishes, that it was meet that each should exercise this judgment on persons subject to them, whether with respect to territory, or by any personal right, for this reason, that otherwise confusion and perturbation would be introduced,” inasmuch as after the establishment of dioceses and parishes it states it to be meet to guard against confusion, that the power of absolving may be exercised on subjects, so understood, as if for the valid use of this power, the ordinary or that subdelegated jurisdiction were not necessary, without which the Council of Trent declares that absolution given by a priest was of no moment: False, rash, pernicious, contrary and injurious to Trent, erroneous. Ibid. § 11. XXXVIII. Likewise the doctrine in which, after the synod declared that it could not but admire that so venerable discipline of antiquity, which, as it says, “did not so easily, and perhaps never admitted to penance him, who, after the first sin and the first reconciliation, had relapsed into crime,” subjoins, “that by the fear of perpetual exclusion from communion and peace, even in articulo mortis, a rein will be thrown on those who but little consider the evil of sin, and fear it still less:” Contrary to the 13 can. of the Council of Nice, to the decretal of Innocentius I., to Exuperius of Toulouse, and also to the decretal of Celestinus I. to the bishops of Vienne and the province of Narbonne, redolent of depravity, of which the holy Pontiff expresses a horror in that decretal. Of the confession of venial sins De pœnit. § 12. XXXIX. The declaration of the synod concerning the confession of venial sins, which, it says, it wished was not so frequently practised, lest such confessions may be rendered too contemptible: Rash, pernicious, contrary to the practice of holy and pious persons, approved by the holy Council of Trent. Of indulgences De pœnit. § 16. XL. The proposition asserting, that “an indulgence, according to its precise notion, is nothing else than a remission of part of that penance, which, by the canons, was set to the sinning individual,”—as if an indulgence, besides the bare remission of the canonical punishment, does not also avail to the remission of the temporal punishment, due for actual sins before the divine justice: False, rash, injurious to the merits of Christ, some time since condemned in the 19th art. of Luther. Ibid XLI. Likewise in that which is added, “that the schoolmen, inflated with their subtleties, have introduced an ill-understood treasure of the merits of Christ and the saints, and for the clear notion of absolution from canonical punishment, have substituted a confused and a false one of the application of merits,”—as if the treasures of the Church, whence the Pope grants indulgences, are not the merits of Christ and of the saints: False, rash, injurious to the merits of Christ and of the saints, before now condemned in the 17th art. of Luther. Ibid XLII. Likewise in this which it superadds: “that it was still more lamentable, that that chimerical application used to be transferred to the dead:” False, rash, offensive to pious ears, injurious to the Roman pontiffs, and to the practice and sense of the universal Church, leading into an error branded with the stamp of heresy in Peter de Osma, again condemned in the 22nd art. of Luther. Ibid XLIII. In this, also, that it inveighs most impudently against the tables of indulgences, privileged altars, &c.: Rash, offensive to pious ears, scandalous, contumelious to the sovereign pontiffs, and to the practice constantly resorted to by the whole Church. Of the reservation of cases De pœnit. § 19. XLIV. A proposition of the synod, assuming that “the reservation of cases at the present time is nothing else than an improvident tie for inferior priests, and a sound void of sense for penitents accustomed not to care much for this reservation:” False, rash, sounding amiss, pernicious, contrary to the Council of Trent, detrimental to the superior hierarchical power. Ibid XLV. Likewise regarding the hope which it holds out, that it will come to pass “that the ritual and order of penance being reformed, such reservations will no longer have any place,”—as by a studied generality of words it intimates, that by the reformation of the ritual and of the order of penance, made by a bishop or synod, the cases can be done away with, which the Trent Synod (Sess. xiv. c. 7) declares, that the sovereign pontiffs could, by virtue of the supreme power committed to them in the universal Church, reserve for their own peculiar judgment: A proposition false, rash, derogating from the Council of Trent, and from the authority of the sovereign pontiffs, and injurious. Of censures De pœnit. §§ 20, 22. XLVI. A proposition asserting “that the effect of excommunication is only external, as if by its nature it only excludes from the external communication of the Church,”—as if excommunication were not a spiritual punishment, binding in heaven, obliging souls (ex S. Aug. Ep. 250. Auxilio Episcopo, tract. 50, in Joan. n. 12): False, pernicious, condemned in the 23rd art. of Luther, at least erroneous. §§ 21, 23 XLVII. Likewise that which states that it is necessary, according to the natural and divine laws, that whether to excommunication or to suspension the personal examination ought to go before, and accordingly, that the sentences called ipso facto have no other force but that of serious threatening without any actual effect: False, rash, pernicious, injurious to the power of the Church, erroneous. § 22 XLVIII. Likewise that which pronounces “that the form introduced some ages ago is useless and unavailing, of absolving generally from excommunications, into which one of the faithful might have fallen:” False, rash, injurious to the practice of the Church. § 24 XLIX. Likewise that which condemns as null and void suspensions from acquaintance with the case which is not formal: False, pernicious, injurious to Trent. Ibid L. Likewise in this, that it insinuates that it is not lawful for the bishop alone to use the power which Trent confers on him, of legitimately inflicting suspension from acquaintance with the case which is not formal: Detrimental to the jurisdiction of the prelates of the Church. Of orders De ordine, § 4. LI. The doctrine of the synod, which represents that in promoting to orders, this method used to be observed by the custom and establishment of ancient discipline, “that, if any of the clerks was distinguished by sanctity of life, and was esteemed worthy to be raised to holy orders, he used to be promoted to the deaconship or priesthood, even though he may not have taken inferior orders, nor at that time was such ordination said to be per saltum, as was afterwards said.” § 5 LII. Likewise that which intimates, that there was not any other title of ordination than the deputation to some special ministry, such as is prescribed in the Council of Chalcedon, adding (§ 6) as long as the Church conformed to these principles in the selection of sacred ministers, that the ecclesiastical order flourished, but that those happy days had passed away, and that new principles were introduced from time to time, by which discipline was vitiated in the selection of the ministers of the sanctuary. § 7 LIII. Likewise that it reckons among these very beginnings of corruption, that a departure was made from the ancient usage, by which, as it says (§ 5), the Church, treading in the footsteps of the apostle, determined that no one should be admitted to the priesthood, unless he who had preserved his baptismal innocence,—inasmuch as it intimates that discipline had been corrupted by decrees and institutes, (1) whether those by which ordinations per saltum were forbidden, (2) or those by which, according to the necessity and convenience of the churches, ordinations were approved of without a title of special duty, as specially by the Council of Trent ordination to the title of a patrimony, saving the obedience by which those so ordained are obliged to attend to the necessities of the churches, by executing those offices to which they were attached by the bishop for the place and time, as was wont to be done in the primitive Church from the apostolic times, (3) or those by which a distinction of crimes was made by canon law, which render delinquents irregular—as if by this distinction the Church receded from the spirit of the apostle, not by excluding generally and promiscuously from the ecclesiastical ministry all persons whatsoever, who should not have retained their baptismal innocence: A doctrine in each of its parts false, rash, calculated to disturb the order introduced for the necessity and convenience of the churches, injurious to the discipline approved by the canons, and especially by the decrees of Trent. § 13 LIV. Likewise, that which marks as a shameful abuse ever to give alms for celebrating masses and administering sacraments, as also to receive any profit said to be that of the stole, and generally whatever stipend and fee, which might be offered on the occasion of suffrages, or of any parochial function,—as if the ministers of the Church were to be noted with the crime of shameful abuse, whilst according to the received and approved custom and usage of the Church, they use the right promulged by the apostle of receiving temporals from those to whom they minister spirituals: False, rash, detrimental to ecclesiastical and pastoral right, injurious to the Church and its ministers. § 14 LV. Likewise that in which it professes a desire that some measure might be found of removing the petty clergy (by which name he designates the clergy of the lower orders) from cathedral and collegiate churches, by providing otherwise, namely, by honest laymen of somewhat advanced age, by assigning a suitable stipend to the ministry of serving masses and other offices, as acolytes, &c., as used to be done formerly, it says, when such offices were not reduced to the mere show for receiving higher orders, in as much as it finds fault with the institution by which it is provided, that the functions of the lesser orders should be performed or exercised by those only who were appointed or assigned to them (Concil. prov. 4. Mediol.), and that according to the meaning of Trent (Sess. xxiii. c. 17), that the functions of holy orders, from the deaconship to the beadleship, laudably received in the Church from the apostolic times, and in many places for some time intermitted, may be revived according to the sacred canons, and may not be misrepresented by heretics as idle: A suggestion rash, offensive to pious ears, calculated to disturb the ecclesiastical ministry, and to impair the decency which should be observed, as far as is possible in celebrating the mysteries, injurious to the offices and functions of minor orders, and also injurious to discipline approved by the canons, and especially by Trent, favouring the reproaches and calumnies of heretics against it. § 18 LVI. The doctrine which lays down that it seems befitting in canonical impediments which result from misdemeanour, expressed in law, that no dispensation is to be admitted: Detrimental to equity and canonical moderation approved by the sacred Council of Trent, derogating from the authority and rights of the Church. Ibid. § 22. LVII. The prescription of the synod, which generally and indiscriminately rejects as an abuse any dispensation whatsoever, so that more than one residented benefice may be conferred on one and the same person, likewise in this which it adds, that it was satisfied than no one could enjoy more than one benefice, though a simple one, according to the spirit of the Church: Considering its generality, derogating from the moderation of Trent, Sess. vii. c. 5, and Sess. xxiv. c. 17. Of sponsals and matrimony Libell. memor. circa sponsalia, &c. § 2. LVIII. The proposition, which lays down that sponsals, properly so called, contain merely a civil act, which disposes to celebrate marriage, and that the same is entirely subservient to the direction of the civil laws,—as if an act disposing to a sacrament were not in this way subservient to the law of the Church: False, detrimental to the right of the Church as to the effects also flowing from the sponsals by the force of canonical sanctions, derogating from the discipline established by the Church. De matrim. §§ 7, 11, 12. LIX. The doctrine of the synod, asserting that it belongs originally to the supreme power only to affix to the marriage contract such impediments which render it null, and are said to be diriment, because the original right, moreover, is said to be connected with the right of dispensing, adding, “supposing the assent or connivance of the chief persons, that the Church could justly establish impediments severing the marriage contract itself,”—as if the Church could not always and cannot establish impediments in the marriages of Christians by its own right, which impediments may not only impede matrimony, but also render it null as to the tie, by which Christians may also be held bound down in the countries of unbelievers, and dispense in the same: Subversive of the canon 3, 4, 9, 12, Sess. xxiv. of the Council of Trent, heretical. Cet. lib. et memor. circa sponsal. § 10 LX. Likewise the request of the synod to the civil power, to take away from the number of impediments spiritual kindred, and that of public propriety, as it is called, the origin of which is found in the collection of Justinian, then, that “it would restrict the impediment of affinity and relationship arising from any licit or illicit conjunction whatsoever to the fourth degree according to the civil computation through the lateral and oblique line, so, however, that no hope be left of obtaining a dispensation,”—in as far as it attributes to the civil power the right either of abolishing or of restricting the impediments, or of restricting the impediments established or approved by the authority of the Church;—likewise in that part where it supposes that she may by the civil power be despoiled of her right of dispensing regarding impediments established or approved by it: Subversive of the liberty and power of the Church, contrary to Trent, emanating from the heretical principle above condemned. Of the offices, exercises, institutions relating to religious worship—and first of adoring the humanity of Christ De fide, § 3. LXI. The proposition, which asserts, “to adore directly the humanity of Christ, or rather any part of it, would always be divine honour given to the creature,”—in as far as by this word directly it intends to reprobate the worship of adoration, which the faithful direct to the humanity of Christ, just as if such adoration, by which the humanity and enlivening flesh itself of Christ is adored, not indeed for itself and as bare flesh, but as united to the divinity, divine honour were bestowed on the creature, and not rather one and the same adoration, by which the incarnate Word is adored together with his own flesh itself (for the council CP. V. gen. can. 9): False, captious, detracting from and injurious to the pious worship due to the humanity of Christ shown and to be shown by the faithful. De orat. § 17. LXII. The doctrine, which throws back and enumerates devotion towards the most sacred heart of Jesus among the devotions which it censures as new, erroneous, or at least dangerous—understood of this devotion such as it has been approved by the Apostolic See: False, rash, pernicious, offensive to pious ears, injurious to the Apostolic See. De orat. § 10, et append. n. 32. LXIII. Likewise in this, that it reproves the worshippers of the heart of Jesus on this plea also, that they do not advert that the most holy flesh of Christ, or some part of it, or even the entire humanity with its separation or removal from the divinity, cannot be adored with the worship of latria,—as if the faithful adored the heart of Jesus with its separation or removal from the divinity, whilst they adore it, as it is the heart of Jesus, the heart forsooth of the person of the Word, to which it is inseparably united, after that manner, in which the lifeless body of Christ was adorable in the sepulchre in the three days of death, without separation or removal from the divinity: Captious, injurious to the faithful worshippers of the heart of Christ. Of the order prescribed in performing pious exercises De orat. § 14, append. n. 34. LXIV. The doctrine, which universally censures as superstitious “any efficacy whatsoever, which is placed in a definite number of prayers and pious salutations,”—as if the efficacy were to be set down as superstitious, which is taken not from the number considered in itself, but from the prescription of the Church, defining a certain number of prayers or external acts for obtaining indulgences, for fulfilling penances, and generally for performing sacred and religious worship duly and according to order: False, rash, scandalous, pernicious, injurious to the piety of the faithful, derogating from the authority of the Church, erroneous. De pœnit. § 10. LXV. The proposition, stating “that the irregular din of new institutions, which were called exercises or missions, perchance never, or at least very rarely, goes so far as to effect conversion, and that those external acts of commotion, which have appeared, were nothing else but passing flashes of natural concussion: Rash, ill-sounding, pernicious, injurious to pious usage, frequently adopted in a salutary manner by the Church, and founded in the word of God. On the mode of combining the voice of the people with the voice of the church in public prayers De orat. § 24. LXVI. The proposition asserting “that it would be contrary to the apostolic practice and the counsels of God, unless more easy methods were prepared for the people of joining their voice with the voice of the whole Church”—understood of the use of the vulgar tongue to be introduced into the prayers of the liturgy: False, rare, calculated to disturb the quiet prescribed for the celebration of the mysteries, easily productive of several evils. Of the reading of the sacred scriptures Ex nota in fine decr. de gratia LXVII. The doctrine representing that nothing but real inability excuses from reading the Sacred Scripture, adding still further that they detect the obscurity which has arisen from the neglect of this precept over the primary truths of religion: False, rash, calculated to disturb the quiet of souls, otherwise condemned in Quesnell. On publicly reading proscribed books in the church De orat. § 29. LXVIII. The praise with which the synod very much recommends Quesnell’s commentaries on the New Testament, and other works favouring Quesnell’s errors, although proscribed, and proposes the same to parish priests, that they may read them over to the people after the other offices, as though replete with solid principles of religion, each in his respective parish: False, scandalous, rash, seditious, injurious to the Church, cherishing schism and heresy. Of sacred images De orat. § 17. LXIX. The prescription, which generally and without distinction marks among the images to be taken away from the Church, as affording a handle for error to the ignorant, the images of the incomprehensible Trinity: On account of its generality, rash and contrary to the pious custom frequently adopted by the Church, as though there were no images extant of the most holy Trinity, generally approved and safely to be permitted. (Ex brevi Solicitudini nostræ, Benedicti XIV. an. 1745.) LXX. Likewise the doctrine and prescription generally reprobating all special worship, which the faithful are wont to pay to some image specially, and to have recourse to it rather than to another: Rash, pernicious, injurious to the pious usage frequently adopted by the Church, as well as to that order of providence according to which God willed not that those things should be done in all [churches] to the memory of the saints, he who distributes his own to each according as he wills. (Ex S. Aug. ep. 78. Clero, senioribus et universæ plebi ecclesiæ Hipponen.) LXXI. Likewise that which forbids that the images, especially of the Blessed Virgin, be not distinguished by any titles, except by denominations, which may be analogous to the mysteries of which express mention is made in Sacred Scripture,—as if other pious denominations could not be affixed to images, which it approves and recommends, even in the very public prayers of the Church: Rash, offensive to pious ears, injurious to the veneration due more especially to the Blessed Virgin. LXXII. Likewise that which wishes the custom to be extirpated as an abuse, by which certain images are kept veiled: Rash, contrary to the custom introduced to cherish the piety of the faithful. On festivals Libell. memor. pro fest. reform. § 3. LXXIII. The proposition stating that the institution of new festivals had originated from neglect in observing old ones, and from false notions of the nature and end of the same solemnities: False, rash, scandalous, injurious to the Church, favouring the reproaches of heretics on the festival days celebrated by the Church. Ibid. § 8. LXXIV. The deliberation of the synod on transferring to the Lord’s day festivals instituted annually, and that by the right, which it says it is convinced is in the bishop’s power regarding ecclesiastical discipline in order to things merely spiritual, and, therefore, that of abrogating the precept of hearing mass on days on which that precept still prevails according to an ancient law of the Church; and also in this, which it superadds, of transferring to Advent, by episcopal authority, fasts to be kept every year according to the precept of the Church,—inasmuch as it attaches to the bishop that it is lawful, by his own right, to transfer days prescribed by the Church for celebrating festivals or fasts, or to abrogate the precept once introduced of hearing mass: A proposition false, detrimental to the right of general councils and sovereign pontiffs, scandalous, and favouring schism. On oaths Libell. memor. pro juram. reform. § 4. LXXV. The doctrine which states, that in the times of the Church, at its birth, oaths appeared so foreign to the teachings of the divine preceptor, and to the golden evangelical simplicity, that the very swearing, without extreme and inevitable necessity, was deemed an irreligious act, unworthy of a Christian man; moreover, that the continued series of the fathers demonstrated that oaths were considered as forbidden by the general feeling; and thence it proceeds to disapprove of the oaths, which the ecclesiastical court, following the standard, as it says, of feudal jurisprudence, has adopted in the investitures and in the very sacred ordinations of the bishops, and has laid it down that a law is therefore to be implored from the secular power for abolishing oaths, which are exacted even in ecclesiastical courts for undertaking duties and offices, and generally for every act relating to the court: False, injurious to the Church, detrimental to ecclesiastical right, subversive of the discipline introduced and approved by the canons. On ecclesiastical collations De collat. ecclesiast LXXVI. The vituperation, with which the synod attacks the school, as that “which opened the way for introducing novel systems, disagreeing the one with the other, as to truths of greater value, and at length brought matters to probabilism and laxism”—in as far as it throws back upon the school the vices of private individuals, who may have the power to abuse it, or have abused it: False, rash, injurious with respect to the most holy men and doctors, who cultivated school learning, to the great advantage of the Catholic religion, favouring the bitter reproaches of heretics. LXXVII. Likewise in what it adds, “that the change of form in the ecclesiastical government, by which it has come to pass, that the ministers of the Church came into a forgetfulness of their rights, which are their obligations, has brought the matter to such a pass, that it caused the primitive notions of the ecclesiastical ministry and of the pastoral solicitude to be obliterated,”—as if, through change of government corresponding to the discipline established in the Church and approved, the primitive notion of the ecclesiastical ministry, or pastoral solicitude could ever be obliterated and lost: A proposition false, rash, erroneous. § 4 LXXVIII. The prescription of the synod concerning the order of the things to be treated in collations, by which, after premising, “In any article whatever that is to be distinguished, which pertains to faith and to the essence of religion, from that which is appertaining to discipline,” it subjoins, “In this itself we must distinguish what is necessary or useful to retain the faithful in spirit from that which is useful or too burthensome for the liberty of the sons of the new covenant to brook, or rather from that which is dangerous or injurious, as leading to superstition or materialism,”—inasmuch as, considering the generality of the words it comprehends, and subjects to the prescribed examination even the discipline established and approved by the Church, as if the Church, which is ruled by the Spirit of God, could establish discipline, not only useless and too burthensome for Christian liberty to submit to, but also dangerous, hurtful, leading to superstition and materialism: False, rash, scandalous, pernicious, offensive to pious ears, injurious to the Church and Spirit of God, by whom itself is ruled, at least erroneous. Reproaches against some propositions hitherto agitated in Catholic schools Orat. ad synd. § 1. LXXIX. The assertion, which casts reproaches and contumelies on the propositions in the Catholic schools, and regarding which the Apostolic See has considered that nothing was as yet to be defined or pronounced: False, rash, injurious to the Catholic schools, derogating from the obedience due to apostolic constitutions. On the three rules laid down as a foundation by the synod for reform of regulars Libell. memorial. pro reform. regular. § 9. LXXX. Rule 1, which determines universally and indiscriminately, “that the regular or monastic state cannot be consistent with the cure of souls, and with the functions of pastoral life, and consequently cannot come in for a share of ecclesiastical hierarchy, without being at direct variance with the principles of the monastic life itself: False, pernicious, injurious to the most holy fathers and prelates of the Church, who associated the institutes of the regular life with the offices of the clerical order, contrary to the pious, ancient, approved usage of the Church, and the sanctions of the Sovereign Pontiffs; as if monks, whom austerity of morals and holy training of life and faith recommends, could not be associated duly with the offices of clergymen, and not only without offence to religion, but also without great advantage to the Church. (Ex S. Siricio, Epist. decret. ad Hemerium Tarracon. c. 13.) LXXXI. Likewise in this which it subjoins, that Saints Thomas and Bonaventura were engaged in such a manner in defending the institutes of mendicants against the greatest men, that in their defences less warmth, greater accuracy was to be wished for: Scandalous, injurious to the most holy doctors, favouring the impious contumelies of condemned authors. LXXXII. Rule 2, “that the multiplication and diversity of orders introduced naturally perturbation and confusion;” likewise in that which it premises, § 4, “that the founders of the regulars, who came forth after the monastic institutions, superadding orders to orders, reformations to reformations, effected nothing else, but more and more to extend the primary cause of the evil,”—understood of the orders and institutes approved by the Holy See, as the distinct variety of pious offices, to which distinct orders were devoted, must by their nature create perturbation and confusion: False, calumniating to the holy founders and their faithful followers, and also injurious to the Sovereign Pontiffs themselves. LXXXIII. Rule 3, in which, after premising, “that a small body living within a civil society, without being a part of the same, and establishing a little monarchy therein, is always dangerous,”—on this plea occasionally attacks private monasteries, associated by the tie of a common institute, especially under one head, as so many special monarchies, dangerous and mischievous to a civil republic: False, rash, injurious to regular institutes approved by the Holy See for the interest of religion, favouring the cavils and calumnies of heretics against the same institutes. Of the system or complication of ordinations derived from the rules adduced, and included in the eight articles following for the reformation of regulars LXXXIV. Art. 1: “About retaining one order only in the Church, and selecting in preference to all others the rule of Saint Benedict, as well on account of its excellence, as for the distinguished merits of that order, so, however, that in those matters which shall perchance occur less suitable to the condition of the times, the mode of life established at Port Royal may hold out a light to try what it may be necessary to add, what to subtract.” 2. “That those who may have joined this order may not be made partakers in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, nor promoted to holy orders, except at most one or two, to be initiated as curates or capellani of the monastery, the others remaining in the simple order of laymen.” 3. “That one monastery only is to be admitted in each state, and that that should be placed outside the walls of the city, in rather sequestered and remote situations.” 4. “Among the occupations of monastic life, its own share must be reserved for manual labour inviolate, a suitable time, however, being left to be bestowed on psalmody, or even, if it shall please any one, on the study of literature. Psalmody should be moderate, because too great prolixity engenders precipitancy, trouble and straying. The more psalmody is increased, as also orisons and prayers, in just an equal proportion is the fervour and sanctity of regulars always diminished.” 5. “No distinction perhaps should be admitted between monks, or those devoted to the choir or to the ministries; that inequality has at all time excited the most serious contentions and discords, and has driven the spirit of charity from communities of regulars.” 6. “A vow of perpetual stability is never to be tolerated. The old monks were not aware of that, who still were the consolation of the Church, and the ornament of Christianity. The vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience, are not to be admitted as a common and stable rule. If any one should be disposed to make those vows, either all or some, he will demand advice and leave from the bishop, who, however, will never permit that they should be perpetual, nor shall they exceed the limits of a year. Only the power shall be given to renew them on the same conditions.” 7. “The bishop shall have every care to examine into their life, studies, and progress in piety; to him it shall appertain to admit and expel monks; always, however, taking the advice of the associates.” 8. “The regulars of the orders, which still remain, may be admitted into this monastery as priests, provided they should desire to devote themselves in silence and solitude to their own sanctification, in which case an opportunity would be created for a dispensation in the general rule set down as number 2, so, however, that they follow not a mode of life different from others, so that not more than one or two masses at most be celebrated every day, and that one ought to be sufficient for the other priests to celebrate with the community.” Also for the reformation of nuns § 11 “Perpetual vows not to be allowed up to the fortieth or forty-fifth year! Nuns are to be devoted to solid exercises, especially to labour; to be called away from carnal spirituality, by which most of them are distracted; it is to be considered whether, with respect to them, it would be better that the monastery should be left in the city:” a system subversive of discipline flourishing, and now from ancient times approved and received, pernicious, opposed, and injurious to the apostolic constitutions, as well as to the enactments of several even general councils, and especially that of Trent, abetting the reproaches and calumnies of heretics against monastic vows, and regular institutes addicted to the more stable profession of evangelical counsels. On convening a national council Libell. memor. pro convoc. concil. nation. § 1. LXXXV. The proposition, stating that any ecclesiastical knowledge whatsoever of history is sufficient for any one to be obliged to acknowledge, that the convening of a national council is one of the canonical ways, by which controversies regarding religion may be terminated in the Church of the respective nations,—so understood, that controversies regarding faith and morals, in whatever church they may have arisen, can be terminated by an indisputable decision by a national council, as though exemption from error in questions of faith and morals were applicable to a national council: Schismatical, heretical. We command, therefore, all the faithful in Christ of both sexes, that they presume not concerning the aforesaid propositions, to think, teach, or preach contrary to the declaration made in this our constitution; so that whoever either collectively or separately shall teach, defend, publish them, or any one of them, or shall treat of them by disputing on them, in public or in private, unless it may be by impugning them, subjects himself to ecclesiastical censures, and other penalties enacted by law against those perpetrating similar acts, by the very fact, without any other declaration. But by this express reprobation of the aforesaid propositions and doctrines, we by no means intend to approve other things contained in the same book, especially since in it have been detected several propositions and doctrines, whether akin to those which were above condemned, or such as evince a rash contempt of the common and approved both doctrine and discipline, and most particularly a hostile feeling towards the Roman pontiffs and the Apostolic See. But we consider two matters to be especially noted, which dropped from the synod, if not with an evil intention, at least rather imprudently, regarding the most august mystery of the most holy Trinity (§ 2, Decreti de Fide), which may readily drive into mischief, the ignorant more especially, and the incautious. First, whilst, after it duly premised that God in Himself is one and most simple, immediately after adding that God Himself is distinguished in three persons, erroneously abandons the common and approved formula in the institutions of the Christian doctrine, by which God is said to be one indeed in three distinct persons, not distinct in three persons; by the change of which formula, this danger of error creeps in by force of the words, that the divine essence is supposed distinct in persons, which Catholic faith confesses to be one in distinct persons, so that it professes it at the same time wholly indistinct in itself. The other is that which it states regarding the three divine persons themselves, that they, according to their personal and incommunicable properties, more strictly speaking, are expressed or called the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, as though the appellation of Son, consecrated by so many passages of Scripture, would be less proper and exact, which by the very voice of the Father came down from the heavens and from the cloud, as well in the formula of baptism prescribed by Christ, as also in that illustrious confession in which Peter was pronounced blessed by Christ himself, and that should not rather be retained which the angelic preceptor, having been taught by Augustine, taught in his own turn, that “in the name of the Word the same property was conveyed, as in the name of the Son,” Augustine saying, for instance, “For the same thing is He called Word as Son.” Nor is that signal temerity of the synod, full of fraud, to be passed over in silence, which dares not only to set off with the highest encomiums the declaration of 1682, some time since disapproved by the Apostolic See, but in order to establish for it greater weight, insidiously to include it in the decree inscribed de Fide, openly to adopt the articles contained in it, and to seal with a public and solemn profession of these articles matters which were stated in a scattered and detached way throughout this same decree. For which reason have we not only far graver cause for expostulating regarding the synod than our predecessors, with respect to that meeting (of the Gallican clergy), but further, no inconsiderable injury is inflicted on the Gallican Church itself, which the synod deemed worthy to have its authority called in to patronize the errors with which that decree was contaminated. Wherefore, whatever acts of the Gallican Convention, on their coming forth soon after, our venerable predecessor, Innocentius XI., by a letter in the form of a brief, on the 2nd of April, 1682, but afterwards more expressly, Alexander VIII., in the constitution Inter multiplices, on the 4th of August, 1699, in virtue of their apostolic duty, disapproved, rescinded, and declared null and void; our pastoral solicitude more forcibly requires of us to condemn and reprobate the recent adoption of these same acts which took place in the synod, and which laboured under so many vices, such adoption being rash, scandalous, and especially as being extremely injurious to the Apostolic See, as we reprobate and condemn it by this our present constitution, and wish it to be considered reprobated and condemned. To that class of fraud it appertains, that the synod, comprising in this very decree several articles regarding faith, which the theologians of the faculty of Louvain laid before the judgment of Innocentius XI., as well as twelve others also presented by Cardinal de Noailles to Benedict XIII., hesitated not to awaken an idle and silly fiction from the Second Council of Utrecht, which was reprobated, and inconsiderately blazoned it among the multitude, that it was well known to all Europe that those articles were submitted to the most rigorous examination at Rome, and that they not only escaped free from any censure whatsoever, but that they were recommended by the aforesaid Roman pontiffs; of which asserted commendation, however, there is no authentic document extant; nay more, this same is contradicted by the proceedings of the examination, which are preserved in the tablets of our Supreme Inquisition, from which this only appears, that no judgment had been published regarding them. For these causes, therefore, we prohibit and condemn, by apostolic authority, by the tenor or these presents, this same book, entitled “Atti e decreti del concilio diocesano di Pistoria, dell’ 1786. In Pistoria, per Atto Bracali, stampatore vescovile. Con approvazione,” inscribed either with the preceding or some other title, wheresoever, or in what idiom soever, in whatsoever edition or version hitherto printed or to be printed; as in like manner we prohibit and interdict all other books in its defence, or in defence of that doctrine, edited in manuscript as well as printed, or to be edited, which God forbid, as also the reading of them, copying, retention, and use, to all and each of the faithful in Christ, under pain of excommunication, to be incurred ipso facto by those who disobey. We recommend, moreover, to our venerable brethren, patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops, and other ordinaries of places, as well as to the inquisitors of heretical perverseness, by all means to constrain and force all refractory and rebellious persons whatsoever, by censures and the aforesaid pains, and the other remedies of law and fact, invoking even for this purpose, if necessary, the aid of the secular arm. But we desire, that the same credit be given to copies, even printed copies of the same presents, subscribed by the hand of some notary-public, and confirmed by the seal of a person placed in ecclesiastical dignity, as should be given to the original letter itself, if it were exhibited or shown. Let it be lawful, therefore, for no one to infringe, or by rash daring to contravene, this page of our declaration, condemnation, mandate, prohibition, and interdiction. But if any one shall presume to attempt this, let him know that he will incur the indignation of Almighty God, and of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul.
