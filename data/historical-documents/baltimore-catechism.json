      "question_number": "23",
      "part": "The Creed",
      "question": "Can we know God in any other way than by our natural reason?",
      "answer": "Besides knowing God by our natural reason, we can also know Him from supernatural revelation --that is, from the truths, found in Sacred Scripture and in Tradition, which God Himself has revealed to us. All scripture, inspired of God, is profitable to teach, to reprove, to correct, to instruct in justice. (2 Timothy 3:16) 23a. What do we mean when we say that God has revealed these truths to us? When we say that God has revealed these truths to us we mean that He has made them known to certain persons, to be announced to their fellow men as the word of God. 23b. What is the Bible? The Bible is the written word of God, committed to His Church for the instruction and sanctification of mankind. 23c. What do we mean when we say that the entire Bible is inspired? When we say that the entire Bible is inspired we mean that its principal author is God, though it was written by men whom God enlightened and moved to write all those things, and only those things, that He wished to be written. 23d. How is the Bible divided? The Bible is divided into the Old Testament, written before the coming of Jesus Christ, and the New Testament, written after His ascension into heaven. 23e. Are all the passages of the Bible to be understood according to our modern manner of expression? No; some of the passages of the Bible are not to be understood according to our modern manner of expression, since they contain certain figures of speech, parables, and literary forms used by the people of ancient times but not employed in the present. 23f. How can we know the true meaning of the Bible? We can know the true meaning of the Bible from the teaching authority of the Catholic Church, which has received from Jesus Christ the right and the duty to teach and to explain all that God has revealed. In these epistles there are certain things difficult to understand, which the unlearned and the unstable distort, just as they do the rest of the Scriptures also, to their own destruction. (II Peter 3:16) 23g. Are Catholics encouraged by the Church to read the Bible? Yes; Catholics are encouraged by the Church to read the Bible, especially the Gospels, which tell about the earthly life of Jesus Christ, the Son of God made man. 23h. What is the chief message of the New Testament? The chief message of the New Testament is the joyful announcement of our salvation through Jesus Christ. These things are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing, you may have life in His name. (John 20:31) 23i. What is Divine Tradition? Divine Tradition is the unwritten word of God – that is, truths revealed by God, though not written in the Bible, and given to the Church through word of mouth by Jesus Christ or by the apostles under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. 23j. Has Divine Tradition ever been committed to writing? Divine Tradition has been committed to writing, especially by saintly writers called Fathers, who lived in the early centuries but were not inspired, as were those who wrote the Bible. 23k. Has Divine Tradition the same force as the Bible? Yes; Divine Tradition has the same force as the Bible, since it too contains God's revelation to men. 23l. By what kind of act do we believe the doctrines contained in the Bible and in Divine Tradition? We believe the doctrines contained in the Bible and Divine Tradition by an act of divine faith, which means that we accept them on the authority of God, who can neither deceive nor be deceived.

In order that a person be a member of the Mystical Body in the full sense, it is necessary that he be baptized, that he profess the Catholic faith, and that he neither separate himself from the Mystical Body nor be excluded by lawful authority.

A baptized person separates himself from full incorporation in the Mystical Body by heresy when he openly rejects or doubts some doctrine proposed by the Catholic Church as a truth of divine-Catholic faith, though still professing himself a Christian. 169d. When does a baptized person separate himself from full incorporation in the Mystical Body by apostasy? A baptized person separates himself from full incorporation in the Mystical Body by apostasy when he openly rejects the entire Christian faith. 169e. When does a baptized person separate himself from full incorporation in the Mystical Body by schism? A baptized person separates himself from full incorporation in the Mystical Body by schism when he openly refuses obedience to the lawful authorities of the Church, particularly to the Pope. 169f. When is a baptized person separated from full incorporation in the Mystical Body by lawful authority? A baptized person is separated from full incorporation in the Mystical Body by lawful authority when he incurs one of the more severe forms of excommunication.
