      "title": "Of the Holy Scripture",
      "content": "Although natural revelation shows God's attributes, it is not sufficient to give that knowledge of God, and of his will, which is necessary unto salvation. God chose to reveal Himself through Scripture to preserve truth and comfort the Church. The Holy Scripture contains all books of the Old and New Testaments, which are given by inspiration of God to be the rule of faith and life. The Apocryphal books are no part of the canon of the Scripture, and therefore are of no authority in the Church of God. Scripture's authority comes wholly upon God (who is truth itself) the author thereof: and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.",

In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost.",

This their sin God was pleased, according to His wise and holy counsel, to permit, having purposed to order it to His own glory. By this sin they fell from their original righteousness and communion with God, and so became dead in sin, and wholly defiled in all the faculties and parts of soul and body.",

Man, in his state of innocency, had freedom and power to will and to do that which is good and well-pleasing to God; but yet mutably, so that he might fall from it.

By it a sinner, out of the sight and sense not only of the danger, but also of the filthiness and odiousness of his sins, as contrary to the holy nature and righteous law of God, and upon the apprehension of His mercy in Christ to such as are penitent, so grieves for and hates his sins as to turn from them all unto God.",
