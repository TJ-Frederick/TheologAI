# Next Session Prompt for Claude Code

## Context

TheologAI MCP server development is transitioning from Phase 2.5 to Phase 3. We just completed ESV footnotes integration and multi-translation support.

## Current State

**Phase 2.5 Complete âœ…**
- ESV HTML endpoint integration with footnote extraction
- Real textual variants and translation alternatives (not just markers)
- Multi-translation support (ESV + NET Bible)
- Graceful handling of verses without footnotes
- All tests passing (6 ESV, 10 NET, 8 CCEL)

**What Works:**
- `bible_lookup`: Clean Scripture text in ESV or NET
- `commentary_lookup`: ESV text + footnotes (textual variants, translation alternatives)
- `classic_text_lookup`: CCEL classic texts with automatic section resolution
- `historical_search`: Creeds and confessions

**What's Missing:**
- Theological commentary (only have textual/translation notes)
- Additional Bible translations (KJV, WEB, ASV)
- Cross-reference system
- Word studies

## Research Findings from This Session

**Key Discovery:** No Bible API provides full theological commentary
- ESV API: Only textual variants and translation alternatives
- NET Bible API: Only note markers, not content
- API.Bible, Biblia API, Bolls.life: No theological study notes
- Study Bible notes (ESV Study, NIV Study) are proprietary/copyright restricted

**Solution:** Public domain commentary integration
- Matthew Henry's Commentary (most comprehensive)
- Jamieson-Fausset-Brown (concise, scholarly)
- Barnes' Notes (detailed, accessible)
- Adam Clarke's Commentary (extensive)

## Next Session Task

### Primary Objective: Research & Plan Matthew Henry Commentary Integration

**Your Task:**
1. Review the updated development plan (`bible-mcp-development-plan.md`)
2. Research available sources for Matthew Henry's Commentary
   - Project Gutenberg, Christian Classics Ethereal Library
   - Look for structured formats (JSON, XML, or easily parseable)
   - Check if verse-indexed versions exist
3. Design the data structure for commentary storage
   - How to index by verse reference
   - How to handle verse ranges
   - How to support multiple commentators
4. Create implementation plan for:
   - Data acquisition and conversion
   - Commentary service/adapter architecture
   - Integration with existing `commentary_lookup` tool
   - Caching strategy
5. Estimate effort and create step-by-step plan

### Secondary Objectives (if time permits):

**Option A:** Start Matthew Henry integration
- If you find a good data source, begin implementation
- Create adapter/service skeleton
- Test with a few sample verses

**Option B:** Quick win - Add KJV/WEB translations
- wldeh/bible-api integration is straightforward
- No API keys needed (GitHub CDN)
- Immediate user value

## Success Criteria

By end of next session, we should have:
1. Clear plan for Matthew Henry commentary integration
2. Identified data source(s) for public domain commentary
3. Data structure design for commentary storage
4. Implementation roadmap with time estimates
5. (Optional) Started implementation if data source is readily available

## Commands for Next Session

**Review current state:**
```bash
npm run build
npm test
git log --oneline -5
```

**Check what needs work:**
```bash
grep -n "TODO\|FIXME" src/**/*.ts
```

**View development plan:**
```bash
cat bible-mcp-development-plan.md | grep -A 50 "Phase 3"
```

## Files to Review

**Essential:**
- `bible-mcp-development-plan.md` - Updated development plan
- `README.md` - Current features and status
- `src/services/commentaryService.ts` - Current commentary implementation
- `src/tools/commentaryLookup.ts` - Commentary tool interface

**Reference:**
- `src/adapters/esvApi.ts` - Example of footnote extraction
- `src/services/ccelService.ts` - Example of external text integration
- `src/adapters/ccelApi.ts` - Example of API adapter pattern

## Key Questions to Answer

1. What's the best source for Matthew Henry's Commentary?
2. Is it already verse-indexed, or do we need to parse it?
3. What data format should we use (JSON, SQLite, other)?
4. How do we handle verse ranges (e.g., "Romans 8:28-30")?
5. Can we support multiple commentators in the same tool?
6. How should we integrate with existing commentary_lookup tool?

## Expected Output

Create a detailed implementation plan document covering:
- Data source recommendation
- Data structure design
- Architecture diagrams (if helpful)
- Step-by-step implementation tasks
- Time estimates
- Testing strategy
- Potential challenges and solutions

## Session Prompt (Copy This)

```
Review the TheologAI MCP server development plan. We just completed Phase 2.5
(ESV footnotes and multi-translation support).

Key accomplishments:
- Real ESV footnotes (textual variants & translation alternatives)
- Multi-translation support (ESV + NET)
- Graceful handling of verses without footnotes
- All tests passing (6 ESV, 10 NET, 8 CCEL)

Key finding: NO Bible API provides full theological commentary. All study Bible
notes are proprietary. We need to integrate public domain commentary sources.

Next priority is Phase 3, Priority 1: Public Domain Commentary Integration.

Tasks:
1. Review bible-mcp-development-plan.md (especially Phase 3 section)
2. Research best approach for integrating Matthew Henry's Commentary
3. Find available data sources (Project Gutenberg, Christian Classics, etc.)
4. Design data structure for commentary storage and indexing
5. Create detailed implementation plan for public domain commentary system
6. Consider data format (JSON), indexing strategy, and API design

The goal: Provide actual theological commentary (not just textual notes)
using public domain resources like Matthew Henry, JFB, or Barnes.

Please review the current state, research available options, and propose
a detailed implementation plan for public domain commentary integration.

If you find a good data source quickly, you may start implementation.
```

**Good luck! This is a high-value feature that will really enhance the Bible study capabilities.**
